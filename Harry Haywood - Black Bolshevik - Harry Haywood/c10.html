<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Lovestone  Unmasked</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto,  Harold  Williams  and  Farmer,  having  completed  their course at  KUTVA, left the Soviet Union after the Sixth Congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  African.  Bankole,  remained  for  further  training  to  prepare him for  work  in  the  Gold  Coast  (Ghana).  At  KUTVA there was another  contingent  of  Black  students  from  the  U.S.  Along with Maude  White,  there  were  now  William  S.  Patterson  (Wilson), Herbert  Newton,  Marie  Houston  and  many more were to come, I  was  then  thirty  and  had  recently  completed  my  last  YCL </p>
<p class="calibre1">assignment  as  a  delegate  to  the  Fifth  Congress  of  the  Young Communist  International  (YC1).  Along  with  my  studies  at  the Lenin  School,  I was continuing my  work in the Comintern.  1 was then  vice-chairman  of the  Negro  Subcommission  of the  Eastern (colonial)  Secretariat,  and  Nasanov  was  chairman.  The  subcommission was established as a “watch-dog” committee to check on  the application of the Sixth Congress decisions with reference to  the  Black  national  question  in  the  U.S.  and  South  Africa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  our  reports,  the  South  Africans  were  applying the line of the Sixth Congress and so we devoted most of our attention to  the  work  in  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the U.S., the minority girded itself fora long struggle against the  Lovestone-Pepper  leadership,  which  had  emerged  from  the Sixth  Congress  battered,  but  not  beaten.  This  leadership  still enjoyed  the  majority  support  within  the  Party.  This  was  due primarily to the widely prevalent belief within  the Party that  this</p>

<p class="calibre1">282</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership was favored  by the Comintern.  Lovestone was loud in his protestations  of support for the line of the Sixth Congress and attempted  to  pin  the  right-wing  label  on  the  minority.  This deception  was  successful  for  a  short  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Cl’s  support  for  Lovestone  seemed  confirmed  by a  letter from  the  ECCI  dated  September  7,  1928,  a  week  after  the adjournment  of  the  Sixth  Congress.  The  letter  contained  two documents. The first was the final draft of paragraph forty-nine of the  “Thesis  on  the  International  Situation  and  Tasks  of  the Communist  International,”  which dealt  with the  U.S.  Party.  The second  was  a  “Supplementary  Decision”  by  the  Political  Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Communist International which  denied  the  minority’s  charge  that  the  Lovestone-Pepper leadership  represented  a right  line  in  the  Party.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paragraph  forty-nine  commended  the  Party,  saying,  “it  has displayed  more  lively  activity  and  has  taken  advantage of symptoms of crisis  in  American  industry,...A  number of stubborn and fierce  class  battles  (primarily  the  miners’  strike)  found  in  the Communist  Party  a  stalwart  leader.  The  campaign  against  the execution  of  Sacco  and  Vanzetti  was  also  conducted  under the leadership  of the  Party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It also criticized  the  Party, stating that “the Party has not with sufficient  energy  conducted  work  in  the  organization  of  the unorganized  and  of  the  Negro  Movement,  and...it  does  not conduct a sufficiently strong struggle against the predatory policy of the  United  States  in  Latin  America.”  It  concluded  by stating, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These  mistakes,  however,  cannot  be  ascribed  to  the  majority leadership  alone....the  most  important  task  that  confronts  the Party is  to put an end  to the factional strife which is not based on any serious differences on principles...” The thesis pointed out that while some rightist errors had been committed by both sides, “the charge against the majority  of the Central Committee of the U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party  of representing a  right  line  is  unfounded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  letter  evoked  great  jubilation  among  Lovestone-Pepper cohorts and  was given widest publicity. A self-laudatory statement from the Central Committee was published alongside the Cl letter in  the  October  3,  1928,  <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker, </i>  It  boasted  that the letter</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a><img src="index-291_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">283</p>
<p class="calibre1">proved  that  the  Cl  “is  continuing  its  policy  of  supporting politically  the  present  Party  leadership/’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  course  we  in  the  minority  resented  Lovestone’s  interpretation  of  the  CPs  letter.  We  felt  that  the  Cl’s  criticisms  of  all factionalism  and  its  rejection  of  our  specific  charge  against  the Lovestone-Pepper  leadership  were  not  equivalent  to  a  political endorsement for Lovestone. The Comintern called for unity in the Party  on  the  basis  of  the  Sixth  Congress’s  decisions.  We  could hardly expect the Cl to come out in support of the minority; it was not a cohesive ideological force itself. The subsequent defection of Cannon  to Trotskyism  further demonstrated the lack of ideological  cohesion  in  the  minority.  Then  there  was  the  hard  fact  that Lovestone  still  held  the  majority  of the  U.S.  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Differences  of  principle  between  the  minority  and  the  Lovestone  leadership  had  begun  to  develop only a half year before at the Fourth Congress of the R1LU in March  1928. These arose over the question of trade unions;  but  even  here they  were  clouded  by factionalism  and  vacillation  on  the  part  of  the  minority.  There was, therefore, substance to the Cl’s charges that both groups had placed  factional  consideration  above  principles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About the same time, the Party was shocked by the defection of James  Cannon  and  his  close  associates  Max  Shachtman  and Marty  Abern.  They  were  exposed  as  hidden  Trotskyists  and expelled  from the  Party.  Cannon’s treachery was first exposed by the minority. This frustrated  Lovestone’s attempt to pin the label of  Trotskyism  on  our  group.  Nevertheless,  Lovestone  sought  to use the Trotsky issue to divert the Party from the struggle against the  main  right  danger.  Later,  the  Comintern  was  to  criticize the minority for its lack of vigilance and its failure to d isassociate itself </p>
<p class="calibre1">“at  the  right time”  from  Cannon’s  Trotskyism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovestone  was  cocky  and  over-confident.  He  was  looking forward  to  wiping out  the minority as a political force in the U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party  at  the  next  convention.  Even  the  recall  to  Moscow  of Pepper,  his  main  advisor  and  co-factionalist,  shortly  after  the return  of  the  U.S.  delegation,  seemed  not  to  shake  his  self-confidencc.  (Pepper  had  originally  come  to  the  U.S.  as  a Comintern  worker and  was thus directly subject to its discipline.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a><img src="index-292_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">284</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">His recall was undoubtedly an indication of Lovestone’s declining support within the Comintern. The Lovestone leadership supported Pepper’s protest against recall. The Cl did not press the issue at the  time  and  Pepper  remained  in  the  U.S.  Shortly  thereafter  he returned  to  his  former  position  in  Party  leadership.  But  the incident was  not forgotten;  it was to be added on the debit side of the  ledger at  Lovestone’s  final  accounting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  came  the  first  blow.  It  was  a  letter  from  the  Political Secretariat  dated  November 21,  1928.  The letter expressed sharp displeasure at  the factional  manner in which  Lovestone had used the previous  letter of September 7. It pointed to the non-self-crideal  and self-congratulatory  character  of the statements issued  by the  majority  in  response  to  the  September  letter  and  expressed emphatic  disapproval  of the claim  by Lovestone that  the Comintern was “continuing its policy of supporting politically the present leadership.”  ‘This  formulation,”  the  new  letter  asserted,  “could lead  to  the  interpretation  that  the  Sixth  Congress  has  expressly declared  its confidence in the majority in contrast to the minority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  this  is  not  so.”2</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  letter  also  called  for  the  postponement  of  the  Party Convention  until  February  1929.  Clearly  Lovestone  had  overreached himself. Coming on the eve of the U.S. Central Committee Plenum,  the  letter  threw  the  Lovestoneites  into  dismay  and consternation.  How  do  we  explain  the  sharpened  tone  of  this letter?  It  was  a  by-product  of  the  heightened  counter-offensive against  the  international  right  and  its  conciliators  which  had gotten underway after the Sixth Congress of the Comintern. It was a  warning  tremor  of the  quake  that  was  to  come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Internationally  the  right  had  crystallized  at  the  congress  and, immediately  following,  it  had  burgeoned  forth in the  USSR and other  leading  parties  of  the  Comintern.  In  Germany  it  was expressed  in  illusions  regarding  the  social  democrats  and  in resistance  to  the  organization  of  left  unions.  In  France  it  was reflected  in  opposition  to  the  election  slogan  of  “class  against class.” In  Britain  it surfaced  as a non-critical attitude towards the Labor  Party  and  a  refusal  to  put  up  independent  candidates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  new  thrust  of  the  right  was  met  by  a  strong  counter</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a><img src="index-293_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">285</p>
<p class="calibre1">offensive.  In  Germany  it  led  to  the  expulsion  of the  Brandler-Thaelheimer  right  liquidationists.  The  Cl  intervened  there  on behalf of Thaelmann against  the conciliators  Ewart and Gerhart Fisler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  Soviet Union, the right line of Bukharin  and his friends had encouraged  resistance on the part of the  <i class="calibre4">kulaks</i> and capitalist elements  to  the  five-year  plan,  industrialization  and  collectivization.  They  resisted  the  state  monopoly  on  foreign  trade.  This was  reflected  in  mass  sabotage,  terrorism  against  collective farmers,  party workers and governmental officials in the countryside,  burning down of the collective farms and state granaries. In the  same  year  (1928),  a  widespread  conspiracy  of wreckers  was exposed  in  the  Shackty  District  of the  Donetz  Coal  Basin.  The conspirators  had close connections with former mine owners and foreign capitalists.  Their aim was to disrupt socialist development. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  result,  the counter-offensive  could no longer  be postponed, and  the  CPSU  was  obliged  to  take  sharp  action  against  the menacing  right  and  its  leaders... Bukharin,  Rykov  and  Tomsky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  opening gun  against  the  right  came  in  October  1928,  at a plenary meeting of the Moscow Committee of the CPSU.  At first, Bukharin was not mentioned by name.  Other  meetings followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  early  February  1929,  at  a joint  meeting  of the  Politburo  and Presidium  of the Central  Control  Commission  (CCC),  Bukharin was  exposed  as  a  leader  of the  hidden  right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  Comintern  itself,  the  struggle  unfolded  after the  Sixth Congress.  As  Bukharin came under attack, his leadership became increasingly  tenuous.  De facto  leadership of the Cl  passed  to the pro-Stalin  forces  and  Bukharin became little more than a figurehead.  His  lieutenants,  the  Swiss  Humhert-Droz  and  the  Italian Celler,  also  came  under attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against  this background,  it  was inevitable that  Lovestone too, would  be smoked  out  in  the  open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We students held what amounted to a dual-party m em bership-enabling us to keep abreast of the situation in both the CPSU and the CPUS A. From our vantage point in Moscow, we had a clearer view  of the  developments  in the  Cl than did  our counterparts at home.  As members of the CPSU  we participated in the fight of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">286</p>

<p class="calibre1">school  against  the  right.  Molotov  himself,  Stalin's  closest  aide, came to the school to report on the decisions of the February  1929, joint meeting of the Central  Commission  of the CC  of the CPSU </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the Moscow Party organization. Along with Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky were exposed as leaders of a clandestine right  in the Soviet  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Molotov  had  moved  into  the  Cl  immediately  after  the  Sixth Congress—a clear political move to offset Bukharin’s leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  he  spoke  authoritatively  on  the  ramifications  of the international  right  and  of  Bukharin  supporters  in  the  fraternal German,  French,  Italian  and other parties.  He didn’t mention the CP USA  or  Lovcstone  in  his  report,  but  we  students  did  in discussion  on  the  floor  following his  report. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Lenin  School was a strong point in the struggle against the Bukharin  right,  just  as  it  had  been  in  the  struggle  against  the Trotsky-Zinoviev  left.  The  school  reflected  in  microcosm  the struggle  raging throughout the  Cl  for the implementation  of the Sixth Congress line against  the right opposition.  Here we had the right  on  the  run.  They  were  in  the  minority  and  at  a  decided disadvantage  from  the  start, for the entire school administration and  faculty  from  Kursanova  (the  director)  down  were  stalwart supporters of the Central Committee of the CPSU and its majority grouped  around  Stalin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  Lovestone  had  made  a  fatal  mistake  in  allowing  so many  able comrades  of the  minority  in  the CPUSA to go to the Lenin  School.  He  had  undoubtedly  already  realized  this,  My group  was  now  in  its  second  year.  The  students  who  had preceded  us,  including  Hathaway,  were  back  in  the  U.S.  and Hathaway  quickly  became an outstanding leader  of the minority group  upon  his  return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  all  had  many  friends  in  the  Russian  Party  and  in  the  Cl, especially among the second level leadership—people important in international  work.  Some  of us  were sent  on  brief international missions—for  example,  the  Krumbcins  were  sent  to  China  and also  to  Britain.  Rudy  Baker, another student from  the U.S., was also sent to China. A number of us American students were invited to participate in meetings  of the  Profintern, the Anglo-American</p>

<p class="calibre1">287</p>
<p class="calibre1">Secretariat and even the ECCI itself on occasions where American questions  were  discussed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  remember one such meeting that I attended as part of a group from  the  Lenin  School.  1  had  been  sent  by  the  school  to  extend greetings to a joint  meeting of the Central Control Commission of the CC of the CPSU and  its  Moscow organization  held January-Fcbruary  1929, as mentioned above. Although 1 felt no need for an interpreter, as my Russian was adequate, Gus Sklar was sent with me.  He  was  a  fellow  student  and  one  of  the  few  supporters  of Lovestone at the school.  A  Russian-American, he was completely bilingual  and  a  very  affable  fellow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In my brief speech of greetings I hailed the victorious struggle of the  CPSU  against  the  right  and  right-conciliators  under  the leadership  of Comrade  Stalin  as setting an example for us in  the American  Party.  “We  have  our  own  right  deviationists,”  1  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bukharin’s  friends  in  the  American  Party  -the  Pepper-Lovestone leadership.” I described the leadership’s theory of American cxceptionalism and its underestimation of the radicalization of the American working class and oppressed Blacks.  J ended my speech in  a  typical  Russian  manner:  “Long  live  the  CPSU  and  its Bolshevik  Central  Committee  led  by  Comrade  Stalin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  listened  attentively  as  poor old  Gus  honestly and accurately translated  my  speech.  It certainly was a  factional speech but  was greeted  with applause  by the Moscow officials and workers in the audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gus left the hall and proceeded immediately to the Lux Hotel to inform  Lovestone’s  crony,  Bertram  Wolfe.  Wolfe  had  recently replaced J.  Louis Engdahl as U.S. representative to the Cl. He had been sent  by  Lovestone in the hope of improving communication between  Moscow  and  the  American  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I recall that he was particularly riled by this speech. Several days later there was  a meeting of the ECCI on the preparations for the American  Party’s  Sixth  Convention  to  which  a  number  of  us students  were  invited  as  usual.  Wolfe,  while  giving  his  report, voiced  a  number of complaints.  Citing my speech,  he questioned the seeming lack  of respect accorded the legitimate representative of the American Party. “How is it,” he wondered, “that Haywood, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p296"></a><img src="index-296_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">a mere student, extends greetings to the Soviet Party.  Why is it that he  is  given  a  platform  at  such  an  important  meeting to launch a factional  attack  on  the  U.S.  Communist  Party?  Why  is  it  that when I report  here,  Lenin School students are always called on to give  minority  reports?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  complaints  were  met  with  stony-faced  silence  by  the members  of the  secretariat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CURTAINS  FOR  LOVESTONE</p>
<p class="calibre1">From  Moscow,  we  students  followed  events  in  the  U,S.  with avid interest. Our line of communication was in good repair, as our stateside  friends  kept  us  well  posted.  We  knew a showdown was imminent.  Finally, the Sixth Convention of the CPUSA convened on*March  1,  1929. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  attended  by  two  special  Cl  emissaries  with  plenipotentiary  powers,  the  German,  Philip  Dengel,  and  the  British Communist  leader,  Harry  Pollitt.  They  brought  with  them  two sets of directives:  the first was  public in the form of the final draft of  the  Cl’s  open  letter  to  the  convention,  and  the  second, confidential  organisational  proposals  designed  to  ensure  the carrying out of the directives of the open letter. The contents of the open  letter  were  known;  it  had  been  circulated  as  a  draft.  We students at the Lenin School had participated in the discussions in the  Cl  in  which  the  letter  was  formulated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The open letter continued the balanced criticism of both groups along the lines  of paragraph forty-nine of the Thesis of the Sixth Congress and the Supplementary Thesis.  It held that both groups were guilty of unprincipled factionalism; it pointed to the absence of differences on principle between them.  It said  both were guilty of right  mistakes.  However,  there was something new in the open letter.  It  pointed  out that the source of the right mistakes of both groups lay in the idea of American exceptionaiism. “Both sides,” it continued,  “are  inclined  to  regard  American  imperialism  as isolated  from  world  capitalism,  as  independent  from  it  and developing  according  to  its  own  laws.”3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a><img src="index-297_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">289</p>
<p class="calibre1">To  us  in  the  minority,  it  seemed  the  scales  were  now  tipped slightly  but definitely against  Lovestone.  Though  both sides were guilty  of  this  error,  it  was  the  Lovestone  faction  which  had articulated it into a full blown theory and which, I felt, held to it the most  strongly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This  mistake  of  the  majority  is  closely  related  to  its  great overestimation  of the economic might and the powerful technical development  of the  United  States.”  In this regard  the open  letter emphasized  that  it  is  “absolutely  wrong to  regard  this  technical revolution  as  a  ‘second  industrial  revolution’  as  is  done  in  the majority thesis.” It was a “serious error,” it stated, to inferthatthe remnants of feudalism were being wiped out in the South and that a  new  bourgeoisie  with  a  new  proletariat  were  being  formed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Such  overestimation  (of  the  results  of  the  development  of technique)  would  play  into  the  hands  of  all  advertisers  of  the successes  of bourgeois  science and  technique who seek  to deafen the  proletariat  by  raising a  lot  of noise  about  technical  progress and  showing  that  there  is  no  general  crisis  of  capitalism;  that capitalism  is  still  vigorous  in  the  U.S.  and  that  thanks  to  its extremely  rapid development,  it is capable of pulling  Europe out of its crisis.” The letter contended that “technical transformation” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  rationalization  lead  “to  further  deepening  and  sharpening of the general  crisis  of capitalism.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  regards  to  the  minority  it  criticized  Bittelman’s  “apex theory ”  and  stated  that  the  “sharpening  of the  general  crisis  of capitalism  is  to  be  expected  not  because  American  imperialism ceases to develop  but  on the contrary it is to be expected because American imperialism is developing and surpasses other capitalist countries  in  its  development,  which  leads  to  an  extreme  accentuation  of  all  antagonisms.”  The  “apex  theory”  is  the  view  that U.S.  imperialism  had reached its peak of development and would soon  be  brought  to  its  knees,  primarily  by  the  weight  of its own internal  contradictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  letter  went  on  to condemn  the  factionalism  in  the  Party, stating, “so long as these two groups exist in the Party...the further healthy  ideological  development  of the  Party  is  excluded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It concluded by putting forth four principal conditions essential</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a><img src="index-298_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">290</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the Party’s “transformation into a mass Communist  Party...the decisive  significance  of  which  neither  the  majority...nor  the minority  have  understood.”  The  four  conditions  were:  “ 1)  A correct perspective in the analysis of the general crisis of capitalism and  American imperialism  which is a part  of it; 2) To place in the center  of the  work  of the  Party  the  daily  needs  of the American working class;  3) Freeing the Party from its immigrant narrowness and  seclusion  and  making the  American  workers  its  wide  basis, paying due attention to work among Negroes; and 4) Liquidation of factionalism  and  drawing workers  into  the  leadership.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly the letter put an end  to any basis for Lovestonc’s claim of Cl  support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  then  were  the  CPs  proposals  for  a  new,  non-factional leadership?  These  were  contained  in  the  confidential  organizational  proposals  brought  by the two Cl  reps,  Dengcl and  Pollitt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  proposals  called for the temporary withdrawal of Lovestone and  Bittelman—considered  the two  main factionalists—from  the U.S.  and requested that they be placed at the disposal of the Cl for assignment  to  international  work.  It advised the appointment  of William Z.  Foster as the new general secretary.  Pepper was again ordered  to  Moscow  immediately  and  forbidden  to  attend  the convention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Formal  acceptance  of  the  line  of  the  open  letter  posed  no difficulties for an unprincipled opportunist of Lovestone’s caliber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  the  letter  was  endorsed  by  both  factions.  But  the organizational  proposals,  which threatened to snatch power from Lovestone,  were  another  matter.  The  crucial question  for  Lovestone  and  company  was  to  retain  contol  of the  Party.  With  his huge  majority  in  the Party, he felt  he was in a pOsSition to bargain with  the  Cl.  But  the  situation  called  for some fast  footwork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  loudly  proclaiming  full  agreement  with  the  political directive  and  proposing  its  unqualified  acceptance,  he  directed his  main  thrust  at  the  organizational  proposals,  claiming  they contradicted the political directive.  Defying the Cl reps, he and his partisans  carried  the  fight  to  the  convention  floor.  There  they launched  an  unbridled  campaign  of  defamation  and  character assassination  against  Foster, who  was  then  favored  by  the  Cl  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">replace  Lovestone,  The  minority,  on its part, charged  Lovestone with  support  of the  deposed  Bukharin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  to  be  outdone,  the  Lovestoncites  supported  a  resolution denouncing  Bukharin  and  calling  for  his  ouster  as  head  of  the Comintern.  Lovestone  had  no  compunction  in  dumping  his former  political  patron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tempers  flared;  fistfights  erupted  on  the  convention  floor.  A group  of so-called  proletarian  delegates  organized  by Lovestone sent a cable to the Cl pleading for a reversal of the organizational proposals,  and  that  the convention  be allowed  to choose its own general  secretary,  subject  of course  to  the  C l’s  approval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The situation was so tense that the  Cl  responded by conceding the right of the convention to elect its own leadership... and thus its general  secretary—with  the  exception  of  Lovestone.  They  still insisted  on  Lovestone’s  and  Bittelman’s  withdrawal  to  Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other  than  that,  the convention  with its Lovestone majority was free  to  elect  its  own  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovestone  made  his  crony  Gitlow  general  secretary.  The  Cl also insisted on Pepper’s return to Moscow. The convention ended up  with  the  appointment  of  several  Lovestone  loyalists  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">“proletarian  delegation,”  which  would  travel  to  Moscow  and plead  the  majority  case  in  the  Comintern.  The  members  of the delegation  were  mainly  Party  functionaries  chosen  for  political reliability.  Led  by  the  majority  leaders  Lovestone,  Gitlow  and Bedacht,  they  went  to  Moscow  to seek the repeal of Lovestone’s assignment to  Moscow and  his prohibition from  CPUSA leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  SCENE  SHIFTS  TO  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the Sixth Congress, Lovestone had succeeded in covering his  flanks  on  the  Afro-American  question.  He  had  proposed Huiswood  as  candidate  for  the  ECC1  (of  which  he  was  now  a member).  Five  Blacks—Huiswood,  Otto  Hall,  Briggs,  Edward Welsh  and  John  Henry—were elected  to  the  new  Central  Committee.  Lovestone’s  “proletarian  delegation”  arrived  in  Moscow</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  April  7,  1929,  its  ten  members  included  two  Black  comrades, Edward  Welsh and Otto  Huiswood.  1 assumed that the line-up of leading Black comrades with the Lovestone crowd represented an alliance  of convenience and  had  little to do with  ideology.  Up to that time there had been no serious discussion in the Party of the Sixth  Congress  resolution  on  the  Negro  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster  and  Weinstone  also  arrived  to  place  the  case  of  the minority  before  the  American  Commission.  Weinstone  had switched  over to  the minority during the Sixth Party Convention and  now  supported  the  Cl  organizational  proposals.  Bitteiman was  also on  hand,  having acceded without protest to his reassignment  to  Comintern  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The American Commission convened a week later, on April  14, 1929,  in a large rectangular hall in the Comintern building.  More than  a  hundred  participants  and  spectators  were  on  hand.  The commission  itself was  an  impressive  group  and  included  leading Marxists  from  Germany,  Britain,  France,  Czechoslovakia  and China.  Among the delegates from the USSR were Stalin, Molotov and  Manuilsky. There were also top officials of the Comintern and Profintern:  Kuusinen,  Gusev,  Mikhailov  (Williams),  Lozovsky, B61a  Kun,  Kolarov,  Kitarov  (secretary  of  the  YCI)  and  Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuusinen  was  chairman  of  the  commission  and  Mikhailov  was secretary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  the  invited  guests  was  our  large  contingent  from  the Lenin School. I sat and looked over the “proletarian delegation” as we waited  for the meeting to start.41 knew Huiswood, having met him  at  the  founding  convention  of  the  American  Negro  Labor Congress  in  1925,  but  1  didn’t  know  Welsh...he was a newcomer, having  been  in  the  Party  only  a  few  months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was Alex Noral, a farmer from the west coast whom I had met  in  Moscow  the  year  before.  There  he  had  worked  in  the Crestintern  (the  Peasant  International)  representing  American farmers. There was Mother Bloor whom I had met previously; she was  a  plump,  kindly-looking  elderly  woman,  formerly  with  the Foster faction.  She always had a twinkle in her eye and her gentle look  belied  her  true  character  as  a  staunch,  fierce,  proletarian fighter.  A  veteran  of  many  labor  battles,  she  was  an  impressive</p>

<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">293</p>
<p class="calibre1">agitator.  I  wondered  what  she  was  doing  in  Lovestone’s  crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  three  others  in  the  delegation  whom  1  didn’t  know: William  Miller,  Tom  Myerscough  and  William  J.  White. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The commission sessions were to last nearly a month, Gitlow led off stating the case for the majority.  A large man, his face screwed up in a perennial frown, he was an ill-tempered sort.  He harangued the  audience  for  two  hours,  pouring  invective  on  the  minority, particularly  Foster.  Boasting  that  the  overwhelming  majority  of the  Party supported  his group,  he praised  Lovcstone, contrasting the  great  (so-called)  “contributions”  of  Lovestone  with  the shortcomings  and  failures  of  Foster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woven throughout was the implication that the Party would be destroyed  if  the  Comintern’s  decisions  were  not  reversed.  He attacked  Lozovsky,  Profintern  chairman,  as  being  virtually  a member of the minority faction.  He wound up his pitch by calling for  a  reversal  of the  Cl  organizational  directives  to  the  CPUS A Sixth  Convention,  stating  that  the  removal  of  Lovestone  from leadership  would  be  a  damaging  blow  to  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster  replied  in  a  more  moderate  tone,  sScoring  the  Pepper-Lovestone  leadership  and  their  theory  of  American  exceptionalism  as  representing  the  right  deviation  in  the  U.S.  Party.  He expressed outrage at the smear campaign launched against him by the  Lovestone  group  which  he  said  was  designed  to  line  up  the Party  against  the  Cl  decisions.  He  called  for  support  of  the Comintern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bittelman  spoke, emphasizing that the downward  swing of the U.S.  economy  was already taking place and  life itself refuted  the Lovestone-Peppcr optimistic prognosis.  Wolfe complained about discriminatory  treatment  by the  ECCI;  how  his status as official representative  of the CPUS A was not recognized and how he was excluded  from  important  discussions  on  the  American question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last,  members of the “proletarian delegation” took the floor and spoke, damning Foster and  praising Lovestone.  After speaking, each one was questioned by members of the commission. The questions  were  designed  to  bring  out  their  understanding  of the issues  involved.  Nothing came out but a parroting of Gitlow and Lovestone. </p>

<p class="calibre1">294</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was  an  undercurrent  of belligerency and  hostility to the commission  and  the  Comintern.  Loyalty  to  Lovestone  was  a hallmark of the delegation.  1  was particularly embarrassed by Ed Welsh.  He  was  a  tall,  handsome, young  Black.  Welsh, I  learned, had  been  in  the  Party  only  a  few  months,  but  was  a  staunch henchman  of  Lovestone,  who  had  placed  him  on  the  Central Committee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he mounted the platform, anger, defiance and disrespect for the commission was written plainly on his face. He launched into a most  vicious  tirade  against  Lozovsky,  the  chairman  of  the Profintern.  Manuilsky,  a  Soviet  member  of the  ECCI  who  was sitting in  front of the rostrum, was so shocked  at  the virulence of this attack against a person of Lozovsky’s stature that he started to rise to  his  feet  in  protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welsh waved him down with his hand, shouting, “Aw, sit down, you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manuilsky flopped back in his chair in open-mouth amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom  Myerscough,  a  mine organizer from  the  Pittsburgh area, also  spoke.  He  was  a  tough-looking,  blustering  ex-miner.  He strode  up  to  the  platform  and  declared  that  he  spoke  three languages,  “English,  profane,  and  today  Fm  gonna  speak  cold turkey,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The running translation came to an abrupt halt and there was a momentary  confusion as the  translators stumbled  over this slang term. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  end,  Myerscough’s  “cold  turkey”  turned  out  to  be just another  rehash  of Lovestone’s  charges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  commission  then  brought  up its  big guns.  Comintern and Profintern  officials—Gusev,  Kolarov,  Lozovsky,  Bela  Kun,  Heller  and  Bell.  They  continued  with  a  balanced  criticism  of  both groups,  but as the meeting went on  more and more emphasis was placed  on  the  mistakes  of the  majority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lozovsky, his eyes twinkling, stepped up joyously to the attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  evident  that  he  welcomed  this  opportunity  to  settle  old scores.  He’d been subject  to  insults and  slanders from  Lovestone and company for several years, and now the day of reckoning had come.  He directed  his main  barbs  against  Lovestone and Pepper, </p>

<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">295</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwelling  at  length  on the “strange case”  of Comrade  Pepper and his  fictitious  travels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pepper was first called back to Moscow in September  1928; the call was repeated in the organizational proposals of February 1929, and  he was ordered  to take no part  in  the U.S.  Party convention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pepper dropped out of sight, giving the impression that  he was on his way back to Moscow.  Pepper’s account of what then happened was that  he went  to  Mexico to seek transportation  by ship to the Soviet  Union.  When no satisfactory arrangements could  be made, he returned to New York  and from there went on to Moscow. But during  the  period  he  was  supposedly  in  Mexico,  he  was  seen  in New  York  at  the  time  of the  Party  convention  there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pepper had returned, we heard, but was not present at any of the sessions.  His case was before the  International Control Commission. (An arm of the Cl, the ICC was composed of representatives of seventeen parties.  Its functions were to supervise the finances of the  ECC1  and  deal  with  questions  of discipline  referred  to  it  by member  parties.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lozovsky dwelt at  length on  Pepper’s mysterious travels; how it was the longest trip on record from New York to Moscow, how he had somehow managed the impossible feat of being in two places at the same time.  He spoke of how Pepper had faced a big decision: either to return to Moscow or remain in the United States-  which meant dropping out of the Party.  It took him a long while to make up  his  mind,  Lozovsky  observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kolarov,  a  huge  Bulgarian,  took  the  floor.  He  referred  to Myerscough’s  “cold  turkey”  speech  with  heavy  humor.  He  conceded  that he lacked  the linguistic skills of some of his American comrades,  and  since  he  didn’t  know  anything  about  this  “cold turkey,”  he  was just  going  to  speak  plain  Russian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalin made his first speech at the commission on May 6. Foster had  introduced  me  to  him  at  the  beginning  of  the  commission sessions.  I guess Foster had wanted  him to know he also had some Black  supporters.  I  had  met  Stalin  before,  but  I  doubt  that  the great  man  had  remembered  me  from  our  first  meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was  now  to  hear  him  speak  for the  first  time.  Garbed  in  his customary  tan  tunic  and  polished  black  boots,  he  stepped to the</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">rostrum.  Very informally  leaning on the stand  with a pipe in  one hand,  he  began  speaking  in  a  calm,  measured,  scarcely  audible voice.  We  had  to  strain  to  hear  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalin emphasized two main points, charging both the majority and minority  factions with  American cxceptionalism and unprincipled  factionalism:  “Both  groups  are  guilty  of the  fundamental error of exaggerating the specific features of American capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  know  that  this  exaggeration  lies  at  the  root  of  every opportunist  error  committed  both  by  the  majority  and  minority groups.”5  Stalin  followed  this  with  a  rhetorical  question:  “What are  the  main defects in  the practice  of the leaders of the majority and the minority?... Firstly, that in their day-to-day work they, and particularly  the  leaders of the  majority,  are guided  by motives of unprincipled  factionalism  and  place the  interests  of their faction higher  than  the  interests  of the  Party, </p>
<p class="calibre1">* “Secondly, that  both  groups,  and particularly the majority, are so  infected  with  the  disease  of  factionalism  that  they  base  their relations  with the Comintern,  not on  the  principle  of confidence, but  on  a  policy  of  rotten  diplomacy,  a  policy  of  diplomatic intrigue.” As an  example he cited  the way in which  both  factions speculated on the “existing and non-existing differences within the CPSU,”  adding  that  they  are  “competing  with  each  other  and chasing  after  each  other  like  horses  in  a  race.”6</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  presented  a  six-point  program  for  a  solution  to  the problems faced by the American Party. This included approval “in the  main”  of the  ECCI  proposals  to the Sixth  Convention  of the CPUS A (except that  relating to the candidacy of Foster); sending of an open letter to all  Party members “emphasizing the question of eradicating  all  factionalism”;  condemning  the  refusal  of  the majority  leaders  to  carry  out  the  ECCI  proposals  at  the  Party convention;  ending  immediately  the  situation  in  the  American Party  in  which  important  questions  of  developing  the  mass movement, “questions of the struggle of the working class against the capitalists,” were “replaced  by petty questions of the factional struggle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalin concluded  by calling for a reorganization of the CPUS A by the secretariat of the ECCI, with emphasis on advancing those</p>

<p class="calibre1">workers “who are capable of placing the interests and the unity of ihe  Party  above  the  interests  of  individual  groups.**  Finally, that  Lovestone and  Bittelman  be  made available for work  in  the Comintern so that everyone clearly understands that “the Comintern  intends  to  fight  factionalism  in  all  seriousness,**7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalin’s  remarks  indicated  why  the  Cl  considered  the  development of the American Party so crucial  and why it spent so much time in resolving its problems: “The American Communist Party is one  of  those  few  communist  parties  in  the  world  upon  which history has laid tasks of a decisive character from the point of view of  the  world  revolutionary  movement....The  three  million  new unemployed  in  America  are  the  first  swallows  indicating  the ripening of the economic crisis in America...I think the moment is not far off when a revolutionary crisis will develop in America.”8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Stalin was speaking, I looked across and saw Lovestone with a leer on his face.  Earlier on during a break in the session, 1 had run into  him  in  the  corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Harry,’* he called to me, “you ought to come over to our side;  we  could  use a  bright  young  fellow  like  you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather  taken  aback  at  the  man’s  gall,  I  said  something  like, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve  got  your  own  Negroes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  that  trash!”  he  said  with a deprecating wave  of his  hand, obviously  referring  to  Huiswood  and  Welsh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shocked  by  his  crudeness,  1  was  strongly  tempted  to ask  how much he thought  I was worth, but I was afraid he might have taken me seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  session  continued  as  Molotov  followed  Stalin,  speaking along basically the same line.  He stressed the need to put an end to the factionalism which had corroded  the  Party and held  back the growth  of the working class  movement.  He concluded by calling on the CPUS A  to “get on a new track....to ensure the liquidation of  factionalism  not  in  words  but  in  deeds,  and  to  ensure  the transformation  of  its  organization”  so  that  the  Party  could prepare itself for  the  sharpening  struggles  and  crises  to  come.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was now clear from the speeches of Stalin, Molotov and other members of the commission which way the wind was blowing. For the  majority,  Stalin’s  speech  was  definitely  an  ill  omen.  Even</p>

<p class="calibre1">298</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">though the subcommittee of the commission (Molotov, Gusev and Kuusinen)  had  not  yet  reported  out  a  draft  of the  commission’s findings,  Lovestone and  company  decided  to force a showdown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From this point on, they began a series of veiled threats against the Comintern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  May  9,  three  days  before  the  subcommittee’s  draft  was presented,  the  Lovestoneites  issued  a  declaration  which  accused the  ECCI  of  supporting  the  minority  against  the  majority  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">“rewarding  Comrade  Foster with its confidence.”  Gambling that they  would  still  be  able  to  control  the  Party  at  home,  the Lovestoneites arrogantly challenged the leadership of the Cl. As a cover  for their  own  splitting activities, they accused  the ECCI of trying to  split  the  American  Party.10</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was clearly the rhetoric of splitting, and was so considered by the members of the commission.  It could only be interpreted as a threat  to  take the  U.S.  Party  out  of the  Cl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  May  12,  the last meeting of the full commission was called into  session.  Kuusinen,  as  chairman,  reported  the  findings  and decisions  of the subcommittee.  Their report  was  in the form  of a draft  address  from  the  ECCI  to  the  membership  of the  CPUSA which  had  been  circulated  the day  before.11 Addressed  over  the heads of the Party leadership, it singled out the Lovestone faction for  its  sharpest  attack.  In  this  respect,  it  went  much  beyond previous criticisms, such as those of the “Open Letter to the Sixth Convention.” It now said that cxceptionalism was “the ideological lever  of  the  right  errors  in  the  American  Communist  Party,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">adding that  exceptionalism:</p>
<p class="calibre1">found  its  clearest  exponents  in  the  persons  of Comrades Pepper  and  Lovestone,  whose  conception  was  as  follows: There is a crisis of capitalism but not of American capitalism, a swing of the masses leftwards  but not in America. There is the  necessity  of accentuating the struggle against reformism but not in the United States, there is a necessity for struggling against the right danger, but not in the American Communist Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The address charged the Lovestone leadership with “misleading honest  proletarian  Party  members  who  uphold  the  line  of  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">299</p>
<p class="calibre1">Comintern,” and “playing an unprincipled game with the question of the  struggle  against  the  right  danger.”  It  termed  Lovestone’s declaration  of  May  9  to  be  a  “most  factional  and  entirely impermissible anti-Party declaration,” stating that it “represents a direct  attempt  at  preparing a  condition  necessary  for  paralyzing the decisions  of the  Comintern  and for a  split  in the Communist Party  of America.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  draft  address  concluded  with  five  points: 1)  A  call  for  dissolution  of both  factions; 2)  Temporary removal of Lovestone and Bittclman from work in the  CPUSA; </p>
<p class="calibre1">3)  Rejection  of the  minority  demand  for  a  special  convention; 4)  A call for the re-organiz.ation of the secretariat of the CC of the CPUSA  on  a  non-factional  basis; </p>
<p class="calibre1">5)  The turning of Pepper’s case over to the International Control Commission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presenting  the draft  address,  Kuusinen  appealed  to  the  Lovestone  delegation: We  call  upon  the  comrades  to  turn  back  from  this  road unconditionally....Our subcommission deems it necessary to call quite definitely upon the delegation as a whole, and upon every  individual  member  of  the  delegation,  to  state  with absolute clearness whether they are prepared to submit to the decisions of the Comintern on the American question and to carry them out implicitly without reservations.  Yes or no? It will substantially depend upon your answer, what character the measures of the Comintern upon the American question shall eventually assume. From your declaration we see plainly that it is no longer a question of factionalism of the leaders of the  Majority of the CC against the  Minority group, but it is already  a  factional  attitude  towards  the  Executive  of the Comintern.12</p>
<p class="calibre1">The majority delegates, after provoking this showdown with the ECCI,  refused  to give a straight answer to the question  posed  by Kuusinen—whether or  not they  would  accept the decisions of the Comintern.  They  backed  away,  postponing a confrontation until May  14.  In the meantime, the majority leaders were secretly taking steps  to  split  the  Party. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  cable  drafted  immediately  after  the  May  12  meeting  and telegraphed  from  Berlin  on  May  15  was  secretly  sent  to  "caretakers” at home, instructing them that the" ...draft decision means destruction of Party.. ..take no action, any proposals by anybody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  cable  went  on  to  state,  "situation  astounding,  outrageous, can’t  be  understood  until  arrival”  and  “possibility  entire  delegation  being  forcibly detained.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  cable  then  instructed  the  majority  cohorts  at  home  to: </p>

<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE’S  MOMENT  OF  TRUTH</p>
<p class="calibre1">May  14,  the  night  of the  big  showdown,  finally  arrived.  The Presidium  of  the  ECCI— the  highest  body  of  the  C om intern-convened to hear the report of the commission and render the final decision  on  the  American question.  The  Red  Hall of the  Comintern  building  was jam-packed  with  participants  and  on-lookers, among  them  top  flight  leaders  of the Comintern  and  Profintern, political workers of both these organizations  and leaders of many affiliate  parties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  Americans constituted  a sizeable group.  In addition to the ten  delegates,  it  seemed  as  though  Moscow’s  entire  American Communist  colony  was  present.  Aside  from  our  large  Lenin School  contingent,  which  had  attended  the  sessions  from  the beginning,  there  were  now  students  from  the  Eastern  University (KUTVA):  Maude White, Patterson, Marie Houston, Bennett and Herbert  Newton. </p>

<p class="calibre1">sessions, tension  had  been steadily building; we waited with eager anticipation for  the  outcome  of the  final  session. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally  the  meeting  was  gaveled  to  order  and  Kuusinen,  the chairman  of the  commission  read  its  findings.  They  were  in  the form  of  an  address  from  the  Executive  Committee  of  the Comintern  to  all  members  of  the  Communist  Party  USA.  He concluded  by  pointing  out  that the  majority delegates had yet  to answer the question he had posed in the commission on the twelfth of the  month.  The  floor  was  then  thrown  open  for discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An angry, scowling Ben Gitlow mounted the platform and read another  declaration  signed  by  the  American  “proletarian”  delegation.  Although  presented  in a  more  diplomatic form  than  the previous  declaration,  this  new  statement  continued  the  same factional  and  anti-Party  attack.  As  later  characterized  by  the ECCI, it was a “direct attempt to nullify the decisions of the Cl and pave  the  way for  an  open  split  in  the  CPUSA.” 14</p>
<p class="calibre1">The declaration opened with some formal phrases asserting the adherence  of its  signers to discipline,  loyalty and devotion to the Comintern, and claim ing to speak for the “overwhelming majority of the  membership”  of the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  went  on  to  charge  the  new  draft  letter  to  be Contrary  to  the  letter  and  spirit  of  the  line  of  the  Sixth (Comintern)  Congress...our  acceptance  of  this  draft  letter would  only  promote  demoralization,  disintegration  and chaos in the Party. This is the only logical outcome of the line of  the  draft  let ter.... There  are  valid  reasons  for  our  being unable to accept this new draft letter, to assume responsibility before the Party membership for the execution of this letter, to endorse the inevitable irreparable damage that the line of this  new  draft  letter  is  bound  to  bring  to  our  Party.^5</p>
<p class="calibre1">The audience sat  in stunned silence at  this  outright  defiance of the  Comintern.  It  was  a  clear declaration  of war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  Gitlow’s  tirade,  members  of  the  Presidium  and leaders  of  other  parties  took  the  floor  and  attacked  the  declaration, point ing out its anti-Party splitting character. They pleaded with  the rank-and-file  members  of the delegation to remain loyal to the  Comintern.  This  plea was joined by a number of our Lenin</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">School  students;  Zack,  Cowl  and  Lena  Davis  all  spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During this part of the discussion,  Stalin took the floor for the second  time.  In  his  usual  calm,  deliberate manner he delivered  a scathing  blast  at  the  majority  leaders—Lovestonc,  Gitlow  and Bedacht.  He  characterized  the  May  9  declaration  as  “super-factional"  and  “anti-Party.”  The  May  14  declaration  was  “still more factional  and anti-Party than that of May 9th." 16 He called the  new declaration a deceitful  maneuver, drawn up “craftily... by some  sly  attorney,  by  some  petty-fogging  lawyer.'’</p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the one hand, the declaration avows complete loyally to the Comintern, the unshakeable fidelity of the authors of the declaration to the Communist  International....On  the other hand,  the  declaration  states that  its authors cannot  assume responsibility  for carrying out the decision of the Presidium of the Executive Committee....If you please, on the one hand, complete  loyalty;  on  the  other,  a  refusal  to  carry  out  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">*  decision  of the  Comintern.  And this  is called  loyalty to the Comintern!...What sort of loyalty is that? What is the reason for this duplicity? This hypocrisy? Is it not obvious that this weighty  talk  of  loyalty  and  fidelity  to  the  Comintern  is necessary  to  Comrade  Lovestone  in  order  to  deceive  the membership?17</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  cannot  be  denied  that  our  American  comrades,  like all Communists, have the right to disagree with the draft of the decision  of  the  Commission  and  have  the  right  to  oppose it.... But... we must put the question squarely to the members of the American delegation; When the draft assumes the force of an  obligatory  decision  of the  Comintern,  do  they  consider themselves entitled  not to submit to that  decision?18</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalin then dwelt  at  length  on the evils  of factionalism  and  his barbs hit us in the minority as well as the majority.  He held up the American  Party  as  an  example  of  the  havoc  factionalism  can wreak.  He  stated  that  factionalism:</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakens  communism,  weakens  the  communist  offensive against  reformism,  undermines  the  struggle of communism against  social-democracy...weakens  the  Party spirit,  it  dulls the  revolutionary  sense...interferes  with  the  training  of the Party in  the spirit of a policy of principles...undermining its iron discipline...completely nullifies all positive work done in the Party.19</p>

<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">303</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  warned  the  majority  against  playing  “trumps  with  percen-inges,”  and  denied  their  claim  of  majority  support  in  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tarty; </p>
<p class="calibre1">You had a majority because the American Communist Party until  now  regarded  you as the determined supporters of the Communist  International.,..But  what  will  happen  if  the American workers learn that you intend to break the unity of ranks  of  the  Comintern?...You  will  find  yourselves  completely  isolated....You  may be certain  of that.20</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalin’s speech really struck home to me. I had been a mem ber of n  faction for the whole five years I had been in the Party; I had been recruited  simultaneously into  the Party and  into a faction, Thus, when  Lovestone  took  over,  I  had  shifted  from  the  Ruthtnbcrg faction to the Foster faction, but after the past month of discussion l here was no getting around the fact that factionalism had harmed 1 he Party’s work.  It was clear the Party could not make the turn to ihc  left  and,  in  particular, develop  the Black  movement without ihc  elimination  of factionalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was now after midnight, and the Presidium was finally called lo vote on the draft address.  It was accepted with one vote against, cast  by its only American member, Gitlow.  A poll was then taken of each  of the majority delegates.  Each was called to the platform and  asked  directly  if he  or she  accepted  the  decision,  yes  or  no? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  ripple  of  excitement  when  Bedacht,  a  majority leader  and  hitherto  staunch  supporter  of Lovestone,  broke  with l he  majority  and  declared  that  he  accepted  the  decision  of  the Presidium and would carry it out. He was joined by Moral, the west coast  farmers’  organizer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovestone  stood  by  the  majority  declaration.  Six  others, including Welsh, answered that while disagreeing with the decision they would follow communist discipline and accept it until it could be  raised  at  the  next  Party  convention.  Gitlow  spoke  last.  He declared that not only did he disagree with the decision, but that he would  actively  fight  against  it  when  he  returned  to  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again  Stalin  took  the  floor,  evidently  dissatisfied  with  the hedging of most  of the  American  delegation.  In  a quiet voice he pointed  out that the American comrades apparently udo not fully</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a><img src="index-312_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">304</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">realize that to defend one’s convictions when the decision had not yet  been  taken  is  one  thing,  and  to  submit  to  the  will  of  the Comintern after the decision has been taken is another/’ He said it involved  the  ability  of  communists  to  act  collectively  and  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">“summed  up as the readiness to conform  the will of the individual comrades  to  the  will  of the  collective.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He denied that the American Communist Party would perish if the  Comintern  persisted  in  its  opposition  to  Lovestone’s  line, arguing  rather  that  “only  one  small  factional  group  will perish.”  The  Presidium  decision,  he  concluded,  was  important because “it will make it easier for the American Communist Party to  put  an  end  to  unprincipled  factionalism,  create  unity  in  the Party and finally enter on the broad path of mass political work.”21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  historic  meeting  was  finally  adjourned  at  3  A.M.  the morning of the fifteenth.  It was nearly summer and, as we passed into  the  street,  the  early dawn  shone on  Moscow’s  gilded church domes.  We  Lenin School students headed towards our dormitory off the Arbot.  At first we were all quiet, each one engrossed in his or her own thoughts,  trying to piece together what  had  happened and  assess  what  it  meant  for  the  Party.  Breaking  the  silence, someone asked  me if I  had  witnessed  the incident  between Stalin and  Welsh  as  we were  leaving the  hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”  1  said,  “what  happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  that  on  the  way  out,  Stalin  passed  W'elsh  who  was standing  in  the  aisle  talking  to  Lovestone.  Stalin,  in  a  friendly gesture,  extended  his  hand  to  Welsh,  as  if to  say  “we  have  our disagreements,  but  we’re  still  comrades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welsh  rudely  rejected  the  proferred  hand  and  in  a  loud  voice said  to  Lovestone,  “What  the  hell  does that fellow want?” There was something strange about  Welsh  I  didn’t  like.  His attachment to  Lovestone  seemed  to  transcend  any  communist  or  political principles,  I  wasn’t  really  too  surprised  at  this  incident,  remembering the earlier one with Manuilsky. But I was glad I hadn’t seen it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Lovestone drama  was  drawing to a close.  The Comintern moved  with dispatch to  head  off the threatened split.  On May  17, two days after the Presidium  meeting,  the  Political  Secretariat of</p>

<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">305</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Cl  removed  Lovestone,  Gitlow,  and  Wolfe from  all positions of leadership in the Comintern and in the Party.  At the same time all  three  were  detained  in  the  Soviet  Union  to  await  the  formal disposition  of their cases.  Lovestone was warned that to leave the Soviet  Union  without  permission  of  the  Comintern  would  be considered  a  violation  of communist  discipline.  Bedacht,  Weinstone  and  Foster,  who  supported  the  address,  were immediately sent  home.  Mikhailov (Williams) was also sent to the States as Cl rep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Comintern cabled the 3,000 word address to the CPUS A. It was  received  by  Lovestone’s  caretakers  Minor  and  Stachel,  who immediately  disassociated  themselves  from  Lovestone.  Along with  the leading ten man  majority caucus, they pledged to follow the  Comintern  decisions.  The  Central  Committee  met  the  same day  and  unanimously  called  upon  the  delegates  remaining  in Moscow  to  cease  all  opposition  to  the  CL</p>
<p class="calibre1">On May 20, five days after the meeting of the Cl Presidium, the address  was  published  in  the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i>  and  became  the property  of  the  entire  Party  membership.  Lovestone’s  doubledealing  and  deception  were  now  apparent  to  all.  The  mandate from the  Sixth Convention had  limited  him to  seek  review of the Cl  decisions,  not  to  defy  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the following days, there was a flood of letters and resolutions from  former  Lovestone  supporters  denouncing  him,  repudiating the  actions  of their former leaders in Moscow,  and  unconditionally supporting the Comintern, On  May 24,  Huiswood, Noraland Mother Bloor, who were still in Moscow, issued a statement. They maintained  that  they  still  disagreed  with  the  Cl,  but  had  no intention  of resisting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Central Committee set  up interim  leadership composed of William  Z.  Foster,  Robert  Minor,  W.W.  Weinstonc  and  Max Bedacht  as  acting  secretary.  The  new  leadership  immediately inaugurated  a  mass  campaign  to  educate the rank-and-file  Party members  about  the political  issues  involved  in  the struggle.  This campaign  swiftly swung the vast  majority of the Party behind the CI.  On  June  22,  the  U.S.  Party  was  notified  by  the  Cl  that Lovestone had left Moscow in violation of the Comintern decision</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a><img src="index-314_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">306</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK.  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  without  meeting  his  promise  to  submit  for  publication  a political  declaration  retracting  his opposition.  Gitlow and  Wolfe had  left  before.  Upon his return to the U.S.,  Lovestone continued his splitting maneuvers.  By the end of June, all three were expelled from  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus LovestoneVs attempt to split the Party failed completely. It was repudiated  by almost his entire following.  His boasted ninety percent  majority  shrank  to  two  percent.  Only  a  couple  hundred bitter-end  right wingfactionalists remained loyal to him and were expelled  along  with  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The political and organizational line of the Sixth Congress was soon vindicated.  Scarcely three months after the expulsion of the Lovestoneites  came  the  stock  market  crash  of  October  1929... </p>
<p class="calibre1">signaling the onset of the great economic crisis which was to engulf the entire  capitalist  world  and  exacerbate  the already deepening general  crisis  of  capitalism.  The  crisis  shattered  the  bourgeois liberal  myth  of  American  exceptionalism  perpetrated  by  Lovestone  and  Pepper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  elimination of the six-year-old  factional  struggle and its  chief perpetrators,  unity  was  at  last  achieved.  The  Party  was now  in  a  position  to  carry  through  the left turn  called for by the Sixth  Congress,  now  capable  of  leading  the  great  class  and liberation  struggles  of the  next  decade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  political  degeneration  of the  Lovestone  leaders was  rapid and predictable.  Lovestone formed  a so-called  Communist  Party Opposition  Group,  declaring  its  purpose  to  be the “re-establishment of communism in America.” He kept up the pretense of being a  Marxist-Leninist  for  a  few  years  but  when  his  anti-Party campaign  proved  ineffectual,  the group fell  apart and  Lovestone embarked  on  an  open  anti-communist  course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  later  placed  himself in  the  service  of the  reactionary trade unionists  Matthew  Woll  and  David  Dubinsky,  with  whom  he helped  sponsor  the  AFL-CIO  anti-communist  crusades.  In  1963 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovestone  moved  up  to  international  prominence as  director  of the  AFL-CIO's  Department  of International  Affairs and  George Meany’s  “Foreign  Minister.”  The  International  Affairs  Department  had  its  own  network  of ambassadors,  administrators  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">intelligence agents and collaborated closely with the State Department  and  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (CIA)  in  reactionary subversion  of  trade  union  movements  in  Africa,  Asia,  Latin America  and  Europe.22</p>
<p class="calibre1">John  Pepper was expelled from the  Party by the International Control  Commission,  not  for  his  political  crimes,  but  for  lying with  respect  to  the  trip  to  Mexico  which  he  never  made and  for falsifying  an  expense  account  for  a  fictitious  trip  to  Korea.  He wound  up  working  for  the  Gosplan  (State  General  Planning Commission  in  the  Soviet  Union).  1  occasionally  saw  him  on Tvcrskaya  on  his  way  to  or  from  work.  What  a  come-down  for Pepper!  From  the  glamor  of  international  politics  to  a  bureaucrat’s  desk  in the  Planning  Commission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward  Welsh remained  Lovestonc’s  man-Friday.  Many years later,  in  the early fifties,  I  ran  into  him on  the street in New York City.  We  immediately  recognized  each  other.  Surprised  and curious,  I  asked  if  he  were still  with  Lovestone.  He  said  he was, adding that  he  knew  1  was still with  the  Party.  Neither of us had more to  say; there  was  an  awkward  pause,  we said goodbye and went  our  own  ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back at the Lenin School, we of the former minority were elated by  the decisions of the commission  and  the news of the complete rout  of  the  Lovestoneites  at  home.  The  political  and  organizational decisions of the Comintern were accepted unanimously at a  meeting of American students  held shortly after the close of the commission.  Factionalism  was  condemned  and  the  unity  of American  students  achieved.  It  was  at  this  meeting  that  the  last two  Lovestone  holdouts,  Gus  Sklar  and  H.V.  Phillips,  finally capitulated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  CRIMEA  REVISITED</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was mid-summer and  I was again on my way to the Crimea.  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">looked  forward  with  pleasure  to  revisiting  the  lovely  peninsula with  its  subtropical  climate,  lush  beauty and of course,  its warm and friendly people.  It would be a month until school began, and I</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">intended  to  spend  half  my  time  in  rest  and  relaxation  and  the remainder  in  “practical  work,”  which  in  this  case  was  further observations  on  the  national  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving  in  Sevastopol,  I  went  immediately  to  the  Party headquarters  where  I  presented  my  letter  of  introduction  to  the local Party secretary.  Where did  he think  would be the best place for me to go, I asked. The secretary, a big bluff man of Russian or Ukrainian  nationality,  was  evidently very  busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  anteroom  was  crowded  with  people  undoubtedly  with more  important  business  than  mine,  He, was  polite and friendly, however, and in what seemed to me a split-second decision, he said he knew just the place for me—Alushta, It was a resort town on the coast  about  twenty-five  kilometers  beyond  Yalta,  where  I  had stayed two summers before.  He offered to put me up in a rest home where  his  Party  organization  had  a  number  of  places  reserved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">TJiat  sounded  good  to  me,  and  I  asked  him  if I  would  have an opportunity  to  study  the  national  question  there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,”  he  assured  me, “you’ll  find a number of nationalities in  the  town  there—Tartars,  Greeks,  Karaite  Jews,  Germans, Ukranians  and  even  some  Russians!  How many  more could you want?”  he joked.  And  he  wished  me  good  luck  as  his  secretary called  in  the  next  person  from  the  crowded  anteroom.  I  waited outside  while she typed  the  letter of introduction  and  then asked her  for  directions  to  the  Coast  Artillery  Barracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was a regiment “adopted” by the school in a special fraiernal relationship which included  mutual visits and cultural exchanges, We  students  also  sent  them  literature  and  periodicals  from  our respective  parties.  This  relationship  heightened  their  political understanding  of the  international  situation  and  the  communist movement abroad.  For us it deepened  our insight into the role of the  Red  Army as a politically conscious guardian of Soviet power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  furnished  a  concrete  illustration  of  how  the  Red  Army functioned.  I  had  met  some  of  the  members  of  the  regiment  in Moscow,  but  this  was  to  be  my  first  visit  to  their  barracks.  I arrived  at the barracks which were situated  on the outsk irts of the city near the coast  and was greeted  warmly by the political officer of the regiment whom  1 had met in Moscow.  He introduced me to</p>

<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">309</p>
<p class="calibre1">other officers and  men.  I was then taken on a tour of the gun sights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  big  coastal  guns,  elaborately  protected  behind  earth and  concrete  fortifications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were so expertly camouflaged, that it was impossible from the  sea  to  tell  anything was there.  The  huge guns were hidden in underground  implacements;  each  had  its  own  electrical  system which  raised  it  by  elevator  to  firing  position.  After  firing  they would drop back to their concealed pits. Under each gun was what seemed  to  be  a  virtual  machine  shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  had  observation  posts  established  along  the  coast  to control  the  long  range fire of the guns.  They were proud  of their guns  and  especially  proud  of  their  new  British  range  finding equipment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked  how they had gotten hold of that, and an officer grinned, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘‘Well,  that’s  what  the  British  would  like  to  know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After touring the gun sites,  I felt Sevastopol was well defended against  any  attack  from  the  sea.  But  alas,  the  enemy  attack  on Sevastopol  thirteen years later—during the Second World War— </p>
<p class="calibre1">was not to come from the sea. It came from the land when the Nazi armies  smashed  into  the  Crimea  across  the  narrow  Perekov isthmus connecting the Crimea with the  Ukrainian mainland. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">“hero city”  of Sevastopol was to  withstand  the seige for 250 days before it fell after putting up  a stubborn defense which tied down the powerful  German  army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next  came  the  inevitable   <i class="calibre4">beced</i>—informal  conference—with the army men.  I was plied with questions about the United States, conditions of Blacks, and  Lovestone and the right deviation in the Party.  I  gave  them  a  rundown  on  the recent decisions, described the participation of Comrade Stalin and  the eventual expulsion of the Lovestoneites.  I was impressed by the high political level of the questions  they  posed  and  the  knowledge  they  displayed  of American  affairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  stayed  with  them  overnight  and  was  invited  to  a  big  hearty meal at their mess.  Discussions continued until the bugle sounded lights out. Next morning 1 was escorted to the station. From there, we  drove  a  lovely,  scenic  route  to  the town  of Alushta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alushta was a beautiful little town  by the sea with the Crimean</p>

<p class="calibre1">mountain  range rising immediately behind  it.  1  found  myself in a modern  rest  home  on  the  outskirts  of  town  with  the  beach conveniently  near—a  perfect  place  to  relax  and  rest.  1  met  the Party  Secretary  of Alushta,  a Tartar.  He introduced  me to some members  of  the  Party  Committee  and  town  Soviet.  These committees,  I found, were representative of the various national* </p>
<p class="calibre1">ities  and  ethnic  groups  in  the  area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in general  1 found nothing particularly new on the national question —it was similar to the situation in the Yalta area where I’d been two years before. All groups were living in peaceful harmony and the  cultures  of each  were mutually respected. Stress was laid, however, on  the development of the Turkic language and culture of  the  Tartars,  who  comprised  the  main  nationalities  of  the Crimean  Autonomous  Republic,  about  one-third  of  the  total population  of  the  peninsula,  After  them  came Ukrainians, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Russians, Greeks, Jews, and Germans  in that order. The Tartars, however,  were  regarded  as  the  basic  nationality  and  it  was  their homeland dating from the days of the Golden  Hordes. These were sufficient factors for an autonomous republic to be set up for them in  1921  with  a  Tartar  president. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  after  a couple  of weeks  in  the Crimean  paradise  1  became restless and bored and longed to be back in the hustle and bustle of Moscow.  1  felt  isolated;  I  wondered  what  was  happening  in  the U.S.  Party.  I’d  had  no  news  of  developments  and  had  heard nothing of the unfinished business of the Black national question. 1 </p>

<p class="calibre1">I  returned  to  Moscow  a  few  days  before  the school opened  in order  to  spend  some  time  with  lna.  From  her  1  learned  that  a young  Russian  woman who  worked  in  the  chancellor’s  office  at KUTVA  had  returned  from  vacation  in  the  Crimea  and  was spreading  malicious  slander  about  me,  portraying  me  as  an insatiable womanizer.

<p class="calibre1">students  as  a  scandal-monger,  and  my  friends  there  paid  her  no attention.  But  lna  was  afraid  the  rumors  would  cause  me  some harm  in  other quarters.  I remembered  having seen  the woman  in question  at the rest home, 1 had greeted her, but paid her no more attention.  Perhaps  that  was just  the trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  1  entered  the  Lenin  School  building a few days later,  I ran into  Kursanova.  She greeted  me with a curt nod and a limp hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“1  want  to  have a talk with you, Comrade Haywood,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,  certainly.  Comrade  Kursanova.  When?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In  a  few  minutes,  when  I  get  back  to  the  office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  suspected  then  that  the  slander  campaign  had  reached  the school  and  a  moment  later  my  suspicions  were  shockingly confirmed.  Further  along  the  hall  I  saw  a  group  of  my  fellow students  looking  at  the  wall  newspaper  and  laughing.  On  seeing me,  one  of  them  said,  “Why,  there’s  Harry  himself.”  Greeting them,  1  turned  to  see  the  cause for  their  merriment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There it was —a cartoon captioned “Comrade Haywood Doing Practical Work in a Crimean  Rest Home.” The cartoon portrayed me  surrounded  by  a  dozen  or  so  pretty  Russian  girls.  It  was expertly  drawn,  I  suspected  by  a  professional  artist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  saw  nothing  funny about it.  Furiously  I demanded, “Who in hell  put  that  up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  friends  disclaimed  any  knowledge  of who  had drawn  it  or how  it  had gotten  there.  Someone,  1  believe  it was Springy,  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Calm  down,  Harry!  You’re  taking  it  too  seriously  - it’s  only  a cartoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  slander,”  1  retorted  and  immediately  headed  for  Kursan ova’s  office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,  Comrade  Haywood—you  saw  the  cartoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”  1  said,  “I  saw  it  and  it’s  slander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is  it  now?  Or  is  it  simply  criticism  by  some  of  your  fellow students?  How  about  a  little  self-criticism?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can  it be honest criticism when no one will admit drawing it  and  placing it  on  the  board?”  I  replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  were  at a rest home,” she asked. “How did you  get there when  you  were  supposed  to  be  doing  practical  work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was sent there by the Party secretary in Sevastopol; he saw the</p>

<p class="calibre1">letter  from  the  school  and  knew  what  1  was  supposed  to  do,”  I replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  probably  wanted  to  get  rid  of  you,”  she  pointed  out.  I told her I saw no reason why practical work could not be combined with leisure and  added that my comrades had said the rumor had been  started  there  by  a  known  scandal-monger.  This  cartoon,  I contended,  was just  an echo  of that  malicious  campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Regardless, you shouldn’t  have allowed yourself to get caught in  such  a  situation,”  she  observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  simmered  down  and  we  parted  on  a  friendly  note.  But  the source  of the  cartoon  remained  a  mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  1  remember  I  protested the incident to  Maurice  Childs, the Party  secretary  of  the  English  speaking  sector  and  its  representative to the School Bureau. 1 didn’t see how the cartoon could have  been  posted  without  his  knowledge,  but  he  brushed  the matter  aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The following day however, the picture was removed. 1 believe it was Childs who told me that the artist was a young Mexican in the Spanish  language  section  of  the  school.  I  remembered  two Mexican  comrades  had  entered  the  school  some  months  before, but  like  most  of the  students  they  were  using pseudonyms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this  was  not the end of the story.  A few days after the wall cartoon  incident  I  ran  into  Marie  Houston,  a  Black  KUTVA student  from  the  U  S.  Marie  had  a grudge against  me for taking sides  against  her  in  some  of  her  personal  disputes  with  other students  at  KUTVA.  Apparently  her  grudges  were  many  and extended  to  most  of her  fellow  students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We exchanged cool formal greetings, and as I was about to pass on  she  lashed  out,  “Hey  man,  I’ve  been  hearing  all  about  your carryings  on  in  the  Crimea--that’s  pretty  bad  stuff!  What  you trying  to  do,  scandalize  our name?” she demanded.  “By the  way, when  you  gonna  be  cleansed?  I’m  sure  gonna  be  there!”  she gloated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  referring  to  the  Party  cleansing  (&lt;  <i class="calibre4">chistka)</i>  which  was taking  place  that  fall  throughout  the  Soviet  Union.  I  didn’t take Marie’s threat  lightly.  A few days before, during the cleansings at KUTVA,  she  hurled  a  series  of  violent  and  false  charges  at</p>

<p class="calibre1">LOVESTONE  UNMASKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">313</p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson  and  Maude  White.  They  were  kept  on  the  stand  for hours  attempting to refute them. In Patterson’s case, his cleansing had  taken  up  one  whole  evening  and  was  extended  to  the  next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">William  Wcinstone,  then  official  Party  representative  to  the Comintern  and  also  a  member  of  the  International  Control Commission, finally  interceded to get Pat off the hook.  A curious thing  about  all  this  was  that  to  my  knowledge  Marie  was  never called  to  account  for  her  slanderous  accusations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  day  of  the  Party  cleansings  at  the  Lenin  School  finally arrived.  The  entire  collective  including  the  rector,  the  scrubwoman,  maintenance personnel,  faculty,  clerical  workers and the entire  student  body  gathered  in the  school  auditorium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chairman of our cleansing  committee was none other than the  famous  old  Bolshevik  Felix  Kohn,  member  of the  Central Control Commission of the CPSU.  He had been a member of one of  the  first  Marxist  groups  in  Russia  and  a  friend  of  Lenin—a person with an unchallengeable record. He was a thin elderly man, stem  looking,  with  a  shaggy  goatee  and  flashing  eyes  under bristling  eyebrows.  He  impressed  me  as  a  strict  disciplinarian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He opened  the meeting, called attention to the solemnity of the occasion, and then outlined the task, purpose and t he procedure to be followed.  It  was a process of purification,  he  said, designed to purge  from  our  ranks  all  noxious  elements,  factional  troublemakers  and  self-seeking  careerists  which  a  Party  in  power inevitably attracts to it. Party members were to be examined on the basis of both their individual work assignments and their political commitment  as  members  of the CPSU. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  other  words  it  was  to  be  a  scrutiny  of  both  conduct  and conviction.  All present, whether Party or non-Party,  had the duty to  come  forth  if they had criticisms or charges against any  Party member.  Indeed,  it was permissible for people outside the school, anyone  who  had  a  complaint  against  any  Party  member,  to participate.  The  Party  member on the stand was required to give an autobiography—when, how and why he or she joined the Party, and what he or she was doing to merit renewing their membership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a stern voice, eyes flashing, Kohn warned: “Woe betide anyone who makes false statements or attempts to in any way deceive this</p>

<p class="calibre1">314</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">commission!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  then  listed  the  penalties  which  could  be  given  to  Party members  for various  infractions.  First there was a  reprimand for minor  offenses, a censure for more grave ones, then strict censure with  a  warning  and  expulsion  as  a  last resort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  all  sat  tensely  as  the secretary of the commission  began to call  students  to  the  stand.  The commission  had  five  members - • </p>
<p class="calibre1">sent  by  the  Party  from  outside  the  school.  Each  Party  member upon taking the stand was required to turn his or her membership card over to the commission, to be returned only if the commission felt that he or she had answered all questions to its satisfaction.  In other  words  the  commission  decided  whether  you  retained  the right  to  remain  in  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually  my turn  came.  I  must  admit  I was rather nervous.  I took  the  stand  and  sketched  my  background  and  Party  experiences, what I got out of study at the school, what I intended to do when  I  returned  home.  No  one  rose to  criticize  me.  And  to  my great  relief,  Marie  didn’t  even  show  up.  In  fact,  Kursanova commended  me as a good student  and spoke favorably about my studies  on  the national  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cleansing continued for several exciting days but no serious infraction  of Party  discipline  or lack  of  Party  loyalty was found among our English-speaking group. The cleansing, however, was a more serious matter among students from underground parties in fascist  or semi-fascist countries.  As I remember, a police agent was flushed  out  in  the  Polish  group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  who  had  drawn  that  cartoon? This  mystery was not to  be cleared up  until forty years later, although I had always had some faint  suspicion  as  to  the  artist’s  identity.  I  attended  a  birthday party  for  the  world-renowned  Mexican  muralist  Davido  Si-quieros.  As  a result  of an international protest movement, he had just  been released from prison where he and other revolutionaries had  been  incarcerated,  charged  with  leading  and  fomenting the National  Railway  Strike  of  1959. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a festive occasion  in typical Mexican style, complete with fireworks  and  a  round-the-clock  open  house.  Hundreds  of comrades,  friends  and  neighbors  gathered  to  congratulate  the  great</p>

<p class="calibre1">artist-  As  I was  introduced to  him  by a friend a thought suddenly occurred to  me:  Had  he not been a student at the Lenin School in 1929,  1  asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes/'  he  responded,  looking  at  me  curiously.  “Yes,  1  was there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were  you  the  one  who  drew  a  cartoon  for  the  school  wall newspaper  titled  ‘Comrade  Haywood  doing  practical  work  in  a Crimean  Rest  HomeT  ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His eyes lit up with agleam of recognition. “Yeah, that was me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”  1  said,  “I'm  that  Harry  Haywood.”  We  both  burst  out laughing and  he proceeded  to  tell the others around  us the whole story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who  was the other young Mexican  with you  at the school?” 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, that was Encina.” (Encina was the General Secretary of the Mexican  Communist  Party.)  “He's  still  in jail/’  Sequieros added sadly. </p>
