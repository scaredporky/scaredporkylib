<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Browder’s  Treachery</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When  I  arrived  in  New  York  in  early  September  1945,1  went directly  to  Party  headquarters  on  East  Thirteenth  Street.  The receptionist informed me that Foster was expected at any moment and told  me to have a seat.  A few minutes later Foster appeared, looking  haggard  and  tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  rushed  to  greet  him  with  a  warm,  “Hello,  Bill!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked up, a frown crossing his face as he extended a cold, limp hand. “Hello, Harry, what are you doing here? I thought you were  out  on  the  coast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I just  got  in  from six  months  in  the  Pacific,”  1  explained.  “I came east to see what the Party wants me to do in this fight against Browderism,  what  my  assignment  should  be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His frown deepened. “You  had trouble in New York. You  had trouble  in  Baltimore.  You  had  trouble  in  California.  Now  I suppose  you’ve  come here to  make  some  more  trouble,”  he  said accusingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was taken aback, flabhergasted,  but  before I could protest he snapped, “I don’t have time to talk now, I’ve got a meeting. You’ll have to  come  back  later.”  He  turned  and  strode away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stunned by the brush-off, 1 left the office. I didn’t know what to make  of  it.  Foster  had  never  been  a  warm  person,  but  he  had always been friendly to me before. I guessed that his cold reception reflected a change  in the internal Party situation. The Emergency Convention to reconstitute the Party had taken place a little over a</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">month  before  and  undoubtedly  the  new  National  Board  had discussed the Party cadre. I suspected Foster’s remarks reflected a hostile  attitude  on  the  part  of the  new  leadership  toward  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  decided to find out what was going on. Throughout the war, I had  been  pretty  much  out  of touch with  the developments in the Party and felt  strongly it was time to get back into things. When I discussed  the  Party  situation  with  friends,  I  found  most  were dissatisfied  with  the  manner in  which  the struggle against  Brow* </p>
<p class="calibre1">derism  was  being conducted.  But  it  was  not  until  a  decade  later that  I  and  other comrades were ahle to fully understand the effect of Browderism  on the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much of the history of thestruggle against Browder’s revisionist line  has  been  ohscured  by  distorted  and  self-serving  interpretations  written  by  right  opportunists  and  professional  anticommunists.  I  want to trace this history as I now see it—from the point of view  of the  left, that  is,  the tendency which fought for a Marxist-Leninist line against the revisionism of the time. Much of the  analysis  of the  inner-Party struggles of those fateful  war and immediate  post-war  years,  of  course,  benefits  from  hindsight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder’s  revisionism first appeared as a rounded-out theory in a speech  he delivered  in  Bridgeport,  Connecticut,  on December  12, 1943.1 Its fullest  ideological expression was in his book,  <i class="calibre4">Teheran,</i> <i class="calibre4">Our  Path  to  War and Peace</i>,  published just a few  months later.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder’s  theories  were  a  systematic  set  of revisionist  concepts which  promoted  collaboration with  and  accommodation to,  the imperialist  ruling  class.  It  led  to  a  series  of  right  opportunist policies  which  culminated  in  the  liquidation  of the  Communist Party.  Browder’s theory departed  from the time-tested principles of  revolutionary  class  struggle  basic  to  Marxism-Leninism.  His views emphasized liberal,  reformist  forms of struggle and  left the Party tailing after the bourgeoisie, eventually abandoning entirely the  road  to  revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder drew upon the Teheran agreement, a pact hammered out  between  Roosevelt,  Churchill  and  Stalin  in  Deccmher  1943, establishing unity among the  allied  powers  in  World  War II and opening  the  second  front.  He  transformed  concepts  of an  international  and  diplomatic character,  important  in the  war against</p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">531</p>
<p class="calibre1">fascist  Germany,  into  a  full-fledged  domestic  program. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder  declared  that  a  harmony  of  interests  had  been established  between  labor  and  capital.  He  called  for  a  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">“national  unity”  to  bring full employment,  peace  and  an  end  to periodic  economic  crises.  He  boasted that he was even  willing to welcome J.P. Morgan into this grand coalition and “clasp his hand on  that  and join  with  him  to  realize  it.”3  He  promised  that  the communists  “will  not  raise the  issue of socialism  in such a form and  manner  as to  endanger  or  weaken  that  national  unity,” and assured  the  ruling  class  that  his program was consistent  with the fullest  possible expansion of consumption by the wealthy and the accumulation  of their  private  incomes.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  starting point  of his  new “national  unity” was to continue operating the  American  economy  at full capacity—as during the war—by  seeking  foreign  markets  equal  to  the  war  market.  He proposed  giant  industrial  development  corporations  of  government and business which would extend credit to and invest in “the devastated  and underdeveloped areas of the world,” thus creating </p>
<p class="calibre1">“generations  of peace and  well-being in  the  world.”5</p>
<p class="calibre1">Essential  to  Browder's  line  were  the  same  elements  that historically had lent themselves to right opportunism in America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These included:  A)  American exceptionalism, which saw capitalism  in  the  United  States  as  exempt  from  the  Marxist  laws  of growth and decay which govern the capitalist world. Abandoning all  class  analysis of hourgeois  democracy,  Browder  put  forward the view that “Communism is twentieth century Americanism.” B) Fundamental overestimation of the power and stability of American  imperialism,  which  led  to  the  conclusion  that  revolutionary struggle  for  socialism  was  impossible.  Q   Basic  great  nation chauvinism  which  opposed the oppressed  and colonized  peoples’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">struggles for liberation  from the yoke of imperialism and  instead portrayed  the  imperialist ruling class as the  bearers  of prosperity and democracy.  D) The view that the United States would enter a period  of  class  harmony—a  long  post  war  period  of  class peace  during  which  time  progress  and  prosperity  could  be achieved  within  the  framework  of the  “free  enterprise”  system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">E)  Browder’s  belief  that  Blacks  had  achieved  full equality</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p554"></a><img src="index-554_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">532</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">through “peaceful" development  of capitalism and abandonment of  the  right  of  self-determination.  Browder  believed  that  Black people  had  already  exercised  the  historic  right  of  self-determination  and  opted  for  integration  into  the country  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">whole.6</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  logical  conclusion  of  Browder’s  principles  was  his  contention  that  the  Communist  Party—a  revolutionary  vanguard party  hased  on  Marxist-Leninist  principles—was  no  longer appropriate for  American  conditions.  It  should  be replaced  by a political  association  which  worked  for  reforms  within  the  prevailing  two-party  system  of the  United  States.  This  is  precisely what was done in May 1944, when the Party was dissolved and the Communist  Political  Association  created  in  its  place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder’s  revisionist  line  had  not  developed  overnight.  His Teheran  thesis  was  only  the latest  expression  of a  rightist  trend that  had  been  developing within  the Party for several years.  The origins of Browderism can be traced to his distortion of the united front  policy  of the  Seventh  Congress  (1935)  of the  Communist International.  This  congress  had  called  on  communists  to  build broad united front movements of peoples, governments and parties to  defeat  fascism where  it  had  come to  power and  to prevent  its spread  to  other  countries.  But  the  congress  had  also  explicitly warned  against  the  danger  of  reducing  the  independent  and revolutionary  role  of the  communist  parties  within  such  fronts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  these  warnings  from  the  Communist  International,  the CPUSA  slipped  into  serious  right  reformist  distortions  of  the united  front  policy  under Browder’s  leadership.  Browder led  the retreat from the principles of class struggle which affected all areas of the  Party’s  mass  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Party’s work  in the Black liberation movement felt the first effects  of this retreat.  Scarcely a year after the Seventh Congress called on communists to strengthen their own ranks and maintain the  initiative  within  the  united  front,  the  U.S.  Party  moved  to liquidate  a  main  revolutionary  strongpoint  of  its  work  in  the South,  the  militant  and  communist-led  Sharecroppers  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  years  that  had  followed  my  visit  to  Alabama,  tbe Sharecroppers  Union  had  continued  to  grow.  In  1936,  it  had  a</p>

<p class="calibre1">%</p>
<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">533</p>
<p class="calibre1">membership  of  roughly  10,000,  spread  over  five counties  in  the Alabama  Black  Belt.  It was growing throughout the lower South with 2,500 memhers in Mississippi, Georgia,  Louisiana and North Carolina.7  But  in  October  1936,  the  SCU  was  dissolved  and  its membership merged into the Agricultural Workers Union and the Farmers  Union  of Alabama.8 This  latter was  an  organization of predominantly white small farm owners and  tenants hased in the northern part of the state, outside the plantation area. This union was  strongly  influenced  by  the racist and right-wing Coughlinite forces.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">In retrospect, I believe that those responsible for liquidating the Sharecroppers  Union  were  motivated  by  a  sort  of  crude  trade union  economism,  a  desire  to  restrict  the  struggle  of Black  soil tillers to economic issues (as if this were possible) and a feeling that the existence of an independent and  mainly  Black union with the explosive potential of the Sharecroppers Union would frighten off our new  democratic  front  allies:  tbe  Roosevelt New  Dealers, the Southern  moderates  and  the  CIO  leadership.  As  Camp  Hill, Reeltown,  and  Dadeville  amply  demonstrated,  even the smallest move to change the status quo could lead to armed conflict. In fact, any  demand  to give Blacks a voice in  determining sharecropping conditions or wages was essentially revolutionary as it threatened the existing set-up. One could almost hear the opportunists sighing with  relief upon  the  union’s  dissolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  recall  in  the  late  thirties  listening  to  a  garhled  report by one of our agrarian specialists in which he tried to explain the reason for the move.  The problem  of Black soil  tillers in the deep South was just a part of the general agricultural problem, a matter of getting Blacks and whites together against the common enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Sharecroppers  Union  with  its  militant  program  mainly emphasizing Black grievances had become an obstacle to the unity of Black and  white  Southern  farmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  took  issue with  this  chauvinist  position,  pointing  out  that  it contained a crass underestimation of the national character of the struggle of the Black peasantry in the  South.  I expressed surprise to  hear,  ten years after the adoption  of our revolutionary line on the Afro-American question, what amounted to a reiteration of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p556"></a><img src="index-556_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">534</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">old social democratic position which ignored  the special position of Blacks in the name of unity. The problem of the Black peasantry in the  South  was  not  exactly the  same  as  that  of the  poor white farmers in the South or in the rest of the country. It was a struggle against semi-slave conditions reinforced by racist barbarism, and in  the  long run,  for  the  completion  of the  land  revolution  left  in default  by the  betrayal  of Reconstruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Sharecroppers  Union  had  represented  a  renewal  of that struggle,  a  struggle  that  required  special  forms  and  methods  of organization,  and  its  own leadership.  But  by  1936, the union was dead and a grievous blow had been struck against the movement in the  South.  In  the  face  of the fiercest  repression,  a  sizable  Party organization  with  an  active  YCL,  ILD  and  remarkably  high political development had  been  built  in  the  Black Belt.  When the Party  backed  down  from  the  SCU,  the  whole  Party  structure began  to  atrophy.  By  the  end  of  1943,  all  the  major  Party concentrations in the South were formally dissolved and replaced by  non-communist  education  and  press associations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite such backsliding, the Party entered the war period with a  reputation  as  the  leading  fighter  for  equality  and  Black liberation.  Yet  as  Browder’s line developed, it continually pushed us into a position of tailing after Black reformist leadership. In the thirties, the Communist Party had often been looked upon as “the Party of the Negro people”;  in the forties however, our line led to repeated betrayals of the struggle. Fora broad assortment of Black reformists,  it was just the opportunity they had been waiting for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still  smarting  from  defeat  in  the  Scottsboro  campaign,  they jumped  in to  fill  the  tremendous  void  left  by  our  retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  A.  Philip  Randolph  called  for  a  dramatic  march  on Washington  to  protest  discrimination,  the  Party  leadership backed  away  from  the  issue and  urged “unity”  in  the face of the fascist  enemy.  The  Party  declared  that  the  march  would  create </p>
<p class="calibre1">“confusion  and  dangerous  moods  in  the  ranks  of  the  Negro people.”10  Black newspapers and  the NAACP popularized a mass slogan  of  the  “Double  V”  (Victory  over  Hitler  abroad  and Victory  over  Jim  Crow  at  home),  but  the  Party  leadership rejected the slogan  on the grounds that  it detracted from the war</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p557"></a><img src="index-557_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">535</p>
<p class="calibre1">effort! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occasionally  the  Browder  revisionists  would  give  lip  service opposition  to discrimination and segregation in the armed forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When it came down to a concrete situation, however, their support was considerably less vigorous. For example, four Black WACs at Fort  Devens, Massachusetts, were court-martialed  for protesting their  commanding  officer's  demand  that  they  should “do  all  the dirty  work.”  Outraged  churches,  unions,  newspapers  and  civil rights  organizations  quickly  organized  and  forced  the  Army  to reverse itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party  leadership,  however,  reprimanded  the  WACs,  Ben Davis  stated,  “The  U.S.  general  staff  has  on  many  occasions... </p>
<p class="calibre1">proved  that  they  deserve  the  full  confidence  of  the  Negro people...we cannot  temporarily stop the war until all questions of discrimination  are  ironed  out.”11</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  slogan  of  the  right  of  self-determination  was  officially dropped  in  1944.  But  it  was  clear  that  the  revolutionary  line  it symbolized  had  been  suppressed  for  some  years.  James  Ford explained the new perspectives for Black equality to the Party. He stated  that  the  economic  expansion  which  Teheran  promised would  “open  up  the  South  for  unprecedented  development  that will raise the standard of living from the degradation and poverty which  have  held  back  the  entire  Southern  people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  Ford,  not  only  would  reactionary  Southern Congressmen  be  driven  from  office  under  such  conditions,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">“American  democracy  as  a  whole  will  be  strengthened  and  the Negro people will be  fully integrated  into  our American society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  advances  will  be irrevocably secured,  providing the democratic,  win-the-war  forces,  including  the  Negro  people,  stand solidly  behind  our  Commander-in-Chief.”12</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party’s  work  in  the  trade  union  movement  also  suffered from  Browder’s  opportunist  distortions  of the  united  front.13  In 1939,  the  Party  dissolved  its  system  of  trade  union  fractions, factory  nuclei  and  shop  papers  as  a  concession  to  the  CIO’s leadership, a move which .seriously weakened the Party’s strength in basic industry. This move also accentuated the tendency to hide the Party’s face, IntheU A W  and TWUA (Textile Workers’Union</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p558"></a><img src="index-558_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">of America), the  Party retreated  from situations where it  had the support  to  elect  one  or  more  of  its  members  to  leadership  and supported  other  candidates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During World War II, the Party supported the no-strike pledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While it was a generally correct policy for the situation, the Party refused to fight for reciprocal pledges from business  to curb warprofiteering  and  ensure the workers’ standard of living.  Browder opposed  any struggle to extract  such  agreements from  business, viewing  them  as  a  disruption  to  war  production.  He  attacked slogans  like  “equality  of  sacrifice”—which  was  being  raised  by some  Party trade  unionists  as stemming from narrow factional considerations.  Thus,  the  Party  found  itself  tailing  behind  the labor bureaucrats on the day-to-day issues of safety, speed-up and overtime  pay  for  overtime  work, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder’s revisionist theories extended into the field of foreign policy,  resulting  in  nothing  less  than  his  approval  of  American imperialism.14 He argued that the peoples of Latin America should place  their  trust  in  the  Roosevelt  administration  and  the  continuance  of  the  “good  neighbor  policy ”  He  urged  the  Chinese communists to “trust America” and in  1945 openly endorsed  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign  policy as “pressing toward the unity and democratization of China.”*3  Browder abandoned support for the struggles of the oppressed and colonized peoples, arguing that they should rely on the  good  intentions  of the  great  nations  to  gain  their  liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ascendency of Browder’s revisionism was based upon both objective  and  subjective  factors  within  the  Party,  Objectively, bourgeois  ideology  had  long  penetrated the working class movement in the United States, had been nurtured during the reformist years  of the  Roosevelt  era  and  had  thrived  in  an  atmosphere  of inadequate  Marxist-Leninist  training  of  Party  members  and leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The liquidation  of shop units and trade union fractions greatly weakened  the  Party’s  base  among  the  industrial  workers, and weakened t he leading role of the proletariat within the Communist Party.  Combined  with  a  large  influx  of professionals  and  white collar  workers,  this  greatly  broadened  the  social  base  for  revisionism in the Party. The situation was further aggravated by the</p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">537</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership's  ousting  of  some  4,000  Party  members  who  were foreign  born  because of a desire to “Americanize" the Party. This chauvinist  move turned  away many of the most experienced and ideologically  steeled  U.S.  communists  from  Party  activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, a distortion of democratic centralism developed inside the  Party  under  Browders  leadership.  Democratic  discussion, collective  leadership,  criticism  and  self-criticism, and ideological struggle were abandoned.  Browder consolidated an encrusted and entrenched  bureaucratic machine under the direction  of his chief lieutenant, Eugene Dennis. Democratic centralism gave way to, as V.J. Jerome later put it, "dictatorial centralism." Browder himself was  glorified  as  the  "greatest  living  American"  and  became increasingly .infatuated with "contacting influential persons" while actually  isolating himself from  the  working class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By May of 1945, however, Browder's visions of an all-class postwar  alliance  were  already  beginning  to  clash  with  the  harsh realities  of everyday  life.  Even  before the war ended,  layoffs and strikes  had  occurred  in  a  number  of areas.  Led  by  the  U.S.,  the western  allies  made no secret of the fact that  their main target  in the post-war period  would be the Soviet Union  and  the so-called </p>
<p class="calibre1">"communist  menace"  it  represented.  Under  such  conditions, Duclos's  letter  had  a sensational effect on the membership of the CPUSA. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon  its  publication  in  May  of  1945,  the  rank  and  file  were plunged  into  a  series  of  discussions  and  debates.  Discussion bulletins  were  written  and distributed  internally; clubs and whole sections  engaged  in  heated  struggle.  It  was  an  honest  attack  on bureaucracy  and  for  many  this  was  the  first  time  they  had experienced  such  open  political  struggle  inside the  Party.16</p>
<p class="calibre1">Opposition  to Browder gained rapid support and soon resulted in  tbe  Emergency  Reconstitution  Convention  which  was  held  in July  of  1945.  At  this  convention,  the  Party  was  reformed  and Browder's  opportunism  exposed.17  Threatened  by  the  growing rank  and  file  revolt,  the  Party—and  especially the  leadership— </p>
<p class="calibre1">were forced  to  make  self-criticisms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The convention was significant in that it reflected the two trends which  were  to  mark  the  future  history  of  the  Party  struggles</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p560"></a><img src="index-560_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">538</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">against revisionism. On the one hand there was the rank and file— </p>
<p class="calibre1">spurred  to  action  hy  the  Duclos  letter  and with at  least a  partial understanding of the seriousness of the Party’s rightist errors—hut as yet without any clearly defined  leadership.  On the other hand, there  was  the  firmly  entrenched  Browderitc leadership  who  saw their main task as the squashing of the rank-and-file upsurge and holding  on  to their  positions  at  any  cost.  One  day they  spouted Browderism,  the  next  day  they  were  repudiating  his  line—with little  genuine  self-criticism  in  between.  To  me  and  many  of my friends,  such  self-criticism  seemed to he mere  breast  beating and verbal recantation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is no wonder, therefore, that there was much skepticism in the ranks  as  to  the  ability  of  the  old  leadership,  particularly  of Browder’s  ex-lieutenants  like  Eugene  Dennis  and John  Williamson,  to  successfully  wage a  struggle against revisionism.  <i class="calibre4">The</i> old leadership  was  carried  over  almost  intact  into  the  newly  reconstituted  Party.18  But  it  was  precisely  these  people  who  controlled  the  Party apparatus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  main  preoccupation  at  this  time was to short circuit the upsurge  of the  rank  and  file;  to  abort  what  was  most  needed  at that time—a thorough, open ideological struggle, and a period of criticism and self-criticismwhich would he mainly directed against the  right.  Almost  immediately after the convention, however, the new leadership  began to shift the focus  of the struggle away from right  opportunism  to  the  so-called  left  sectarian  danger.  Thus Browderism was exposed pragmatically (in specific manifestations like  Teheran),  hut  the  revisionist  line  it  represented  was  never repudiated  in  a  fundamental  way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along with this came a wholesale attack on the left which is best described by Harrison George, a former editor of the  <i class="calibre4">Daily Worker</i> and   <i class="calibre4">People's  World</i>  (the  Party’s  west  coast  newspaper),  in  a document titled   <i class="calibre4">The Crisis in the CPUS A. </i> Here George related the draconic measures that were taken against so-called Trotskyiteand semi-Trotskyite  elements  in  the  Party,  many  of whom were self-proclaimed  “premature  anti-Browderites.”  As  a  left  opposition grew in strength following the reconstitution of the Party, a number of  cadres  were  expelled.  Many  were  veterans,  even  charter</p>

<p class="calibre1">members, who had laid their lives on the  line for the  Party. Such men as Vern Smith, veteran labor writer for the communist press, Rill Dunne,  an experienced trade  union cadre and at one time the Party’s  representative  to  the  Profintem,  as  well  as  Harrison George  himself,  were expelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">George  states  that  these  expulsions  were  followed  by  mass expulsions  at  the  local  level  and  the  dropping  of  a  number  of dissidents.  Many cluhs were reorganized  by  national and  district level  leadership, some cadres were expelled  with an “increasingly bureaucratic  suppression  of  Party  democracy,  as  membership opposition  passed  over  from  a  passive  to  an  active  form.” 19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually  all  that  remained  of  democratic  centralism  was  centralism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  later  phase  of this  struggle  began  with  the  National  Committee  meeting of  1947.  This period saw the leadership postpone the  national  convention  and  in  so  doing  refuse  to  suhmit  its policies  and  programs  to  the  membership  for  renewal  or  rejection.  The  Fourteenth  Party  Convention  was  finally  held  in August of 1948.  Undoubtedly the right felt the need for more time to  consolidate  its  position.  Such  was  the  case  in  the  period following  the 1945 Convention when they postponed choosing the officers of the  National  Committee  for  a year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PARTY  CHAIRMAN  WILLIAM  Z.  FOSTER</p>
<p class="calibre1">During this period,  William  Z.  Foster rose as the unchallenged leader of the Party, In  1945 the rank and file looked to Foster, and Foster alone among the leadership, to reconstitute the Party on a truly  revolutionary  basis.  The  Party  was  at  a  crossroads  and Foster’s  task  was  a  historic  one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  a  proud  history  in  the  Party  and  the  revolutionary working  class  movement  From  his  years  in  the  IWW  and  the Socialist Party,  he came into the CP with a wealth of experience in the  trade  union  movement.  Foster was a leader of the great steel strike of 1919 which saw some 365,000 workers walk off the joh: In the twenties, he led the struggle against dual unionism and fought</p>

<p class="calibre1">540</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  a  revolutionary  program  for  work  within  the  unions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  development  of  tbe  prestigious  Trade  Union  Education League  (TUEL)  can  be attributed  to  bis  leadership.  As  we  have already mentioned, Foster made some rightist errors in this work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slow  to  see  the  need  for  independent  left-led  unions,  he  later criticized these errors and came to lead the campaign for industrial unionism.  He  was  one  of the  chief architects  of the  CIO. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  task  he  was  faced  with  in  1945,  the  fight  against revisionism,  proved  to  be  beyond  his  capabilities.  While  Foster was  tbe  best  of  the  old  leadership,  he  was  certainly  no  fearless warrior  against  the  right.  Even  before  he  was  thrust  into  the leading role in the Party, his pragmatism had come to the fore as he consistently put political expediency ahead of ideological struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  he  and  Sam  Darcy  had  been  the  only  two members of the National  Board to criticize Browder’s line before the  fateful  arrival  of  the  Duclos  letter.  In  January  1944,  he submitted  a  letter  to  the  National  Committee  which  criticized Browder’s  line.  Duclos  himself had  liberally quoted  Foster,  But publication  of  the  letter  was  suppressed  by  the  National  Committee.20 Foster  did  nothing for fifteen long months, never fought for  his  line  or fought  to  bring his  case  to  the  rank  and  file. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  prc-Convention  discussions  of  1944—a  period which,  according  to  the  Party  Constitution,  is  supposed  to  be marked by the most open and frank discussions and scrutiny of the Party’s  line—Foster  maintained  his  silence.  He  presided  at  the convention  in  May  of  1944  which  dissolved  the  Party and  then went  on  to  nominate  Earl  Browder  for  president  of  the  new Communist  Political  Association—just  four  months  after  his letter  criticizing  Browder’s  line.  In  turn,  Foster  himself  was nominated  hy  Browder  to  serve  as  one  of the  association’s  vice-presidents.  At this same convention, Foster chaired the committee which  prepared  the  charges  to expel  Sam Darcy.  Yet Darcy was expelled for espousing in a more active form the same criticism of Browder  as  Foster  expressed  in  his  January  letter  to  the  NC.2’</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the beginning of the struggle against Browderism,  Foster consistently underestimated the seriousness of the right danger. At the  convention  to  reconstitute  the  Party,  he  cautioned  against</p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">541</p>
<p class="calibre1">“overcorrect ing” the Party’s past errors, and, in this spirit, he swept the  whole  Browder  crowd  back  into  leadership  on  his coattails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only was Foster denying the lessons of the Party’s most recent period,  he  actually  overlooked  the  whole  historic  trend  of  the working class movement in the United  States.  From the Socialist Party  to  Lovestone  to  Browder,  the  main deviation  had  always hcen  right  opportunism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a long time, Foster seemed to think that he could be a buffer between  the various  factions  and groupings in the  Party without ever having to seriously confront the more rightist elements in the leadership.  In  reality,  this  centrist  position  led  him  to  play  a conciliation is t  role  for  the  right.  While  paying  lip  service  to the primacy of the right danger, he actually leveled most of his guns at the  left.  I  assumed  that  his cold  reception  to me when  I  returned from  the  Pacific  was  because  he  associated  me  with  the  “disgruntled left sectarian” elements in the Party, some of whom, like Bill  Dunne,  were  old  friends  of mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his concluding remarks at the Fourteenth Convention  of the CPUSA,  Foster openly stated  that rightism  was the main danger facing the Party.  But he never detailed exactly what the content of these  right  errors  was.  At  the  same  time  he  informed  the membership  that  “our  Party  has  had  to conduct  a  fight  on  two fronts”  and  that  there  were  dangerous  “Leftist  moods”  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leftist  renegade  grouplets”  in  the  Party, that this could  be seen in  the  revolts  in  a  number  of districts,  including New  York  and California.22 He was referring to areas where some of the strongest opposition to rightism developed and where many cadre and cluhs were either expelled  or  dropped  out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is clear that Foster considered the threat from the right to be in abeyance  once  Browder  had  been  removed  from  leadership.  He saw  the  political  struggle—the  fight  to  oust  Browder... as  being primary. In effect, he didn’t understand the importance of fighting the ideological influence of Browderism which still had a firm grip on  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  led  Foster  to so seriously underestimate the right danger and  to tacitly  accept  the  expulsion  of so  many  genuine communists? It can  be safely asserted that these errors were rooted in his</p>

<p class="calibre1">542</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">own tendency towards rightism. Like Browder, he underestimated the leading role of the vanguard party. In his  1944 letter criticizing Browder’s line there is no mention of the dissolution of the Party! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster wrote a postscript to t his letter and the two were pu blished in  the July  1945.  <i class="calibre4">Political Affairs. </i>  In  this postscript, Foster said that  he  had  opposed  the  dissolution  of  the  Party  at  a  board meeting, hut didn’t actively pursue the matter because he thought it  was a lost cause.  He ends  with these words: “So I left the whole question  out  of  my  letter  to  the  National  Committee.  The immediate task, as I saw it, was for me to help to keep the C.P. A., in fact,  if not  in name, the Communist Party.”23 Foster obviously believed that the Party could continue to play a leading role even when  it  was  liquidated  organizationally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,  while  Foster  correctly  criticized  Browder  for  overestimating the progressive aspects  of the monopoly capitalists, he himself overestimated  the  role  played  by  FDR  and  the “liberal labor  combination.”  In  the  same  letter  in  which  he  criticized Browder, Foster writes,“We must understand clearly and definitely  that  the  basic forces  of a  progressive  national  unity  are  those grouped,  in  the  main,  around  Roosevelt’s  banners  and  we  must fight  to  help  them  extend  and  solidify their  ranks.”24</p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster  was  indeed  a  product  of the times—of a  period  in  the Party’s  history  when  the  attack  on  Marxist-Leninist  theory, rightism  and  bureaucracy  had  seriously  undermined  the  inner workings of the Party. In all fairness, it must be said that his ability to  lead  the  Party  was  also  greatly  affected  by  his  poor  health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following a heart attack in  1932, Foster’s activities were seriously limited  and  he  was  forced  to  spend  mucb  of his  time at  home— </p>
<p class="calibre1">removed  from  the  operative  leadership  of the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the final analysis, however, it was his pragmatism—empirical and  superficial methods of evaluating conditions in the Party and the  country—which  led  him to  agree  with the main  tenets of the right,  most  importantly the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism. It was this view that “the struggle is everything, the final aim nothing,” along with an unwillingness to rock the boat, which most  consistently  guided  his  actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His failure to fully break with the right opportunism of Browder, </p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER'S TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">543</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  revisionism,  left  the  door  open  for  the  resurgence  of  a line  which  eventually  liquidated  the  Communist  Party  as  the revolutionary vanguard  of the working class once and for all  His continued vacillation and conciliation to the right helped to lay the groundwork for the final victory of revisionism in the U.S. Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  a  sad  note  that  this  outstanding  leader  of  the  American working class was  in the last years of his life putting forward such revisionist  theories  as  peaceful  transition  to  socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one who lived through the years 1945 to 1948—with perhaps the exception of Harrison George or a very few others—had a full understanding  of  what  was  going  on  in  the  Party at  the time.  I know  that  I  observed  right  errors,  but  1  merely  saw  them  as mistakes and tendencies which could be corrected, not as reflecting a  whole  line  that  would  lead  to  liquidation  of the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  didn’t  really  trust  the  leadership,  especially  Eugene  Dennis (though  I  had  little  actual  personal  contact  with  the  man).  He seemed to me to be the kind of guy who could never make a direct statement.  I knew that he had  been Browder’s right hand man and one of the leaders of the whole right deviation. Once all the breast-beating  was  over,  he  became  general  secretary  of  the  Party, nominated  by  Foster.  1  wondered  then  how  he  had  managed  to weather the change  so  well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the struggle first began against Browder in the latter part of 1945,1 was withdrawn-  still reluctant to become involved in the inner-Party struggle.  But 1 had seen an article by Claudia Jones, a young  Black  woman  communist  from the  West  Indies  who  had challenged  Browder’s line on  the right  of self-determination. The article  had  greatly  stimulated  my  interest.25  I  knew  that  the ideological  struggle  inside  the  Party  was  far  from  over,  and  I thought  that  I  could  play  a  role  in  restoring  our position on the Afro-American question.  But  I was still leery of plunging into the struggle  because  of  the  self doubts  that  hung  over  me  after  my hattleficld  experiences  in  Spain  and  my  work  in  Baltimore.  My heart attack also held me back somewhat, and Foster’s brush-off had  renewed  some  of the  deep  personal  wounds  that  I  felt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was  therefore  somewhat  apprehensive  when  in  December 1945,  Charles  Krumbein,  my  old  Lenin  School  friend,  and  then</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p566"></a><img src="index-566_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">544</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">district organizer for New York, called me into a meeting.  When I arrived,  1  found  in  addition  to  Krumbein:  Bob  Minor,  (I  had always  had  warm  feelings  toward  Bob  which  I  thought  were mutual, despite his close association with Browder); Steve Nelson, former  brigade  commissar in  Spain; and  James Ford, one of the few “casualties”  from  among  the  Browder leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charlie began the meeting by saying that they wanted to*discuss my future work and resolve the Spanish problem once and for all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I recall, he said that he did not believe the rumors that I had left the  front  without  permission,  and  that  Bob  and  Steve  were  in Spain  and  could  substantiate this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  to  him  that  the  rumors  had  been  irresponsible accusations  directed  at  “one  of  our  leading  Negro  comrades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One  can  just  look—although  it  certainly  isn’t  necessary—at Harry’s  World  War  II  seaman’s  record  and  see  that  the  rumors were  not  true,”  he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  concluded  by  saying  that  he  felt  it  was  time  for  all disparaging  rumors,  none  of which  were  ever  made  into  direct charges,  to cease.  And that “Harry should be encouraged to make the  kinds  of contributions to the Party we all  know he is capable of.”  Bob  Minor  said  a  few  words  along  similar  lines  and  Steve Nelson agreed. Only Ford expressed reservations but did not make any  specific  charges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob suggested  that  a  restatement and elaboration of a revolutionary  position  on  the  Afro-American  question  was  urgently needed.  It  had been nearly ten years since such a presentation had been  made.26  I  agreed.  It  seemed  to  me  that  there  was  every indication  of  a  renewed  upsurge  among  Blacks  and  important struggles  were  beginning to  unfold which  required a clear understanding  of the  question  if the  Party  were  to  play  a leading and decisive role.  The rank and file, especially the young Black cadres, were aware of the crucial place the question held in the struggle to root  out  the  influence  of Browderism.  For all of these reasons,  I anxiously took  up  the  task  of writing such  a  book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  felt  at  the  time  that  Krumbein  and  Minor  were  surely  not acting on their own, but rather as a committee of the Politburo set up  to  investigate  the  matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  I  considered  this</p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER'S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">545</p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting as an official clearance  of all accusations stemming from Spain, and felt free to concentrate all my efforts toward writing the book.  For the next two years I spent the major portion of my time working  on  the  manuscript  and  did  a  great  deal  of reading and research while I was still sailing. I had decided then to concentrate on developing an exhaustive examination of the agrarian situation in the South as a basis for the restatement  of the correct position on the  Afro-American  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the meantime, I still had to earn a living. Belle had come in from  Los  Angeles and set  up a small apartment on West  138th Street.  She had gotten a job in a shoe factory and I decided to sign on  another ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CUBA</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  early  March  1946,  I  signed  on  the  motor  ship  the   <i class="calibre4">Coastal</i> <i class="calibre4">Spartan</i>, bound for Havana, as a cook and baker.  She was a small freighter of the same class as the   <i class="calibre4">Turk's Knot</i>, the ship I had sailed on  my  last  voyage  in  the  Pacific. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was my first  trip to Cuba.  When we docked in  Havana,  a young mulatto police sergeant who was in charge of the dock area came aboard.  The chief cook, a Filipino, introduced me to him as Sergeant McClarran. This was not the cook’s first trip to Havana, and  he  whispered  to  me that  McClarran was a  good  fellow.  “He looks  after  our  people  ashore,”  he  confided.  “And  to  show  our appreciation  we  always  make  sure  he  gets a couple of pounds of butter,  which  costs  a  lot  here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sergeant  was  a  tall  strapping  fellow  who  spoke  fluent colloquial English.  He explained to me that he had spent two years in the  United  States  at  the  Cuban  Pavillion  of the  1938 World’s Fair.  Curious, I asked how he got his name. “Oh, my old father was a  Scotsman,”  he  said,  laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On hearing that  this was my  first time in Havana, he offered to show me the city.  We walked out of the harbor area and along the Prado, the main street. We sat down at a sidewalk cafe and ordered some food.  While  we were talking the sergeant  rose and  hailed a</p>

<p class="calibre1">546</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">nattily  dressed  man  with  a  military  bearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He introduced  me as a writer from the  U,S. and we exchanged pleasantries.  The  man  passed  on  and  I  asked  who  he  was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, last  month he was chief of police.  I don’t  know what he’s doing now. I never liked him; he was a real reactionary, one of the hangovers  from  Machado’s  times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  minutes  later,  after  we  had  left  the  cafe,  the  sergeant stopped to greet another man. When I asked who that was, he said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  that’s  our  new  chief of police.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sergeant  seemed  to  be  a  progressive  fellow,  and  he  had undoubtedly  sized  me up  as  a  man  of the left.  As we walked,  we proceeded to discuss the current political situation. The period just after the war was one of popular upsurge as the Cubans sought to realize the democratic aims they had  fought for in World War II. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grau  San  Martin’s  people’s  front  government  was in power and the  Popular  Socialist  Party  (communist)  inspired  and  led  many struggles  of  the  period.  It  was  just  prior  to  the  reactionary offensive,  sparked  by  the  cold  war,  which  swept  Latin  America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I told the sergeant that I was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War and  he insisted  on taking me to a bar where some Cuban veterans hung out.  As we entered I saw one familiar face, a beautiful Black woman  whom  I  had  met  in  Valencia.  I  had  known  her  only slightly;  she  was  actually  in  the  company  of  the  General  El Campesino. The story was that she had played quite a role fighting in  the  trenches  against  the  fascists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recognizing  me  at  once,  sbe  exclaimed,  “El  Capit&amp;n!”  We stood at the bar with the sergeant, who seemed to know everybody, and  he  translated  when  I  needed  it.  I  asked  about  other  Cuban Spanish Civil War veterans.  I had met a few,  but  I had forgotten their names.  Most  bad transferred from the Fifteenth  Brigade to Campesino’s  brigade  after Jarama. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out  in  the  street  again,  I  thanked the sergeant  and asked  if he could  direct  me to the Communist  Party headquarters.  Not  only would  he direct  me,  he said,  but it  would  be an honor for him to escort  me.  We  walked  up  a  main  boulevard  along  the  bay  and stopped  to  look  at  the  statue  of  Antonio  Maceo  on  horseback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maceo  had  been  a  Black  leader  in  the  war  of  independence</p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER'S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">547</p>
<p class="calibre1">against  Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  blocks  further  on  we  came  to  the  headquarters  of the Popular Socialist  Party.  It  was located in what appeared to be an old mansion. We entered the door which opened into a large foyer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were large stairways apparently leading up to offices on the second floor. But the stairs were blocked off by a barricade. Behind it were a few husky-looking young security guards. They seemed to know  the  sergeant  who  told  them,  “This  is  Comrade  Haywood from  the American  Party.  He wants  to  see  Bias.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  them  picked  up  the  phone and  repeated  the  message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,  he  turned  and  motioned  us  up  the  stairs.  We  went  as directed  and  entered  an  open  door where Bias  Roca, the general secretary of the Party,  was standing behind  a desk.  He shook my hand and also the sergeant's, whom he seemed to know. Roca was a  light  brown  mulatto,  as  I  recall,  of short  and  stocky  build. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit down. Sit down,” he said. He said that  he had heard of me, and asked about James Ford, whom he knew. Ford had attended a congress  of  the  Cuban  Party  as  a  fraternal  delegate  several years  before.  I  told  him  that  Ford  had  stuck  too  long  with Browder  and  was  not  in  the  new  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  we  were  also  stuck  with  Browder,  but  we  got  unstuck before  you  comrades  did,”  he  said.27</p>
<p class="calibre1">He then asked about Foster.  I told  him what I honestly thought at  the  time,  that  Foster seemed  to  be all  right  and  that  under his leadership  we  were finally  pulling  out  of the revisionist  swamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  continued  talking  and  he  told  me  about  the  situation  in Cuba,  how  the  Party  had  come  through  the  revisionist  period more  or less  intact,  and  that  they were now in  an  uneasy alliance with  Grau  San  Martin.  It  was  getting  shaky,  however,  “We’re under  no  illusions,”  Roca  told  me,  “With  the  war  ended  we’re expecting a  reactionary  offensive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  also  asked  about  our work among  Blacks.  1  told  him that despite  the  backsliding  with  Browder,  the  Party’s  prestige remained high among Blacks, “There’s a debate going on now, and we’re looking forward  to restoring  our  position.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After we had talked for about an hour, 1 felt I had taken enough of his  time,  and  rose  to  leave,  “Be  sure  to  give my  greetings  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster,”  Roca  said  in  closing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sergeant and  I walked back  to  the docks to sightsee along the  Prado  and  take  in  the  night  life  of Havana.  The  ship  pulled out the next day for Matanzas, the sugar port in Oriente Province where we loaded  sugar for the  States.  The ship docked  in Jersey City  on  April  2,  1946. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  FIGHT  FOR  OUR  REVOLUTIONARY  LINE</p>
<p class="calibre1">On my return, I began hearing more and more about the attack on the left and rumors about  old friends of mine who were under attack.  From what  I could see, all was not well with the Party nor was  the  rank  and  file  satisfied  with  the  course  of  the  struggle against  Browderism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To me, the one bright spot in all this was the struggle to reaffirm our revolutionary position on the Black national question, for the Party  to  once  again  take  up  the  fight  for  the  right  of  self-determination  in  the  Black  Belt.  I  followed  this  whole  question very  closely  and  it was clear to  me that the impetus came mainly from  the  Black  cadres  and  particularly  from  the  new  blood  that had  come  into  the  Party in  the last  decade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  that time,  Blacks  made up fifteen percent of Party membership.  Despite  Browder’s  liquidationist  policies,  the  Party  still maintained  its  reputation  as  a  leader  in  the  struggle  for  Negro rights.28  I  felt  that  this  was  largely  due  to  the  outstanding reputation  the  Party  had  built  for  itself during the campaigns of the  thirties—Scottsboro,  the  ILD,  the  Unemployed  Councils— </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  its  yeoman  work  in  building  the  CIO  and  organizing  the unorganized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party  maintained its fighting reputation through much of the war, despite the opportunist errors that were made. During the thirties and  forties,  this was the basis for the recruitment  of large numbers  of  outstanding  young  Blacks  who  quickly  matured  as leaders at every level of the  Party and  the mass movements.  This core of Black cadres was further strengthened by the return of Black veterans  who  were  acutely  aware  of the  gains  made  during  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">549</p>
<p class="calibre1">course  of  the  war  and  of  how  these  gains  were  now  being threatened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These cadres  played a leading role in the working class struggle and  their  role in  the Party’s strong fight for seniority rights after the war was particularly important. The layoffs of the late forties had a  harsh effect on  Black  workers,  many of whom first entered industry during the war and were often the lowest  in seniority.  A spontaneous  Black  caucus  movement  arose in  these  years  as the top leadership of both the AFL and the CIO steadfastly refused to take  up  the  special  demands  of  Black  workers.  In  1951,  these caucuses united  into  a national  organization, the National Negro Labor  Councils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such struggles deeply affected the cadres and reflected the rising sense of struggle and militancy of Black people in general. I myself was  very  much  aware  of this  new  spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  my  ship  first  docked,  I  spent a  lot  of time walking  the streets  of Harlem.  I  was  struck  with  the  visible  optimism  on the faces of the people passing me in the street. Black people would no longer be cowed and bullied by Jim Crow. They had experienced a mass  political awakening as a  result of their wartime experiences and  this  was  reflected  in  their  manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  war  served  to  break  the  historic  isolation  of  the  Afro-American  people from the  struggles  of the peoples of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  men and women served over a million strong in the armed forces  and  the  wartime  expansion  of  industry  saw  an  unprecedented  number of Blacks, close to a million workers, come into the  U,S.  labor  force.  Through  such  involvement.  Black  people were able to see more than ever that they had allies in the colonially oppressed people abroad and in the U.S. working class at home in their  struggle against  Jim  Crow  and  monopoly  capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  people were deeply  influenced  by the colonial and semicolonial  upsurge  of  World  War  II  as  people  in  India,  China, Indonesia,  Africa,  Latin  America  and  the  liberated  countries  of eastern  Europe  rose up to oppose fascist and imperialist domination.  National  minorities  within  the  boundaries  of  the  Soviet Union had been liberated by the socialist revolution and were now exercising  one  form  or  another  of self government.  More  than</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever,  Afro-Americans  were  determined  to  fight  for equality  and full democratic rights at home. There could be no turning back, no return  to  the  past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  course  of the  war,  momentum  had  been  building toward  an upsurge in the  Black  liberation movement  and it burst into full bloom once the war ended. There was a firm commitment by  Blacks  to  carry  on the fight against  Hitler at  home.  The postwar  period  saw  the  largest  strike  wave  in  history  and  Black workers played a  leading role in it.  In militant strikes and actions led by the  Negro Labor Councils,  Black workers demanded jobs, upgrading  and  training  into  skilled  jobs,  along  with  greater representation in unions and in the leadership thereof. At the same time, they played a very important role in the liberation movement as renewed struggle developed against lynchings, frame-ups. police brutality and the general denial of equality and democratic rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As early as  1946, the Civil Rights  Congress (CB.C) was formed to  replace  the  ILD  which  had  largely  been  liquidated  under Browder.  The  CRC  was  headed  by  my  old  friend  William Patterson  and  in  1951,  it  submitted   <i class="calibre4">We  Charge  Genocide</i>,  a petition to the  United  Nations  “For  relief from the crime  of the United  States  Government  against  the  Negro  people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  formidable  document,  inspired  by  Patterson,  recounts much  of  the  terrorism  of  this  period  when  lynchings  and  Klan activity were on the rise throughout  the country and especially in the  South.  The frame-up in the case of a self-defense slaying and subsequent  life  sentence  of Mrs.  Rosalec Ingram and  her sons in Georgia,  the  burning and  destruction of the entire Black community  of Columbia,  Tennessee,  and  the  frame-up  on  rape  charges and execution  of the Martinsville Seven are but a few examples.29</p>
<p class="calibre1">This spontaneous upsurge made it all the more pressing that the Party  once  again  take  up  the  figbt  for  the  right  of  self-determination. Without such a revolutionary program, the Party would never be able to play a leading role in the struggle or to unite Black and  white  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  veteran  Black  cadres  played  an  important  role  at  this time, but I especially remember the young people. For instance, as I  have already  mentioned.  Claudia Jones’s discussion  article that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p573"></a><img src="index-573_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">551</p>
<p class="calibre1">kicked  off  a  hugh  debate  in  the  summer  of  1945,  attacking Browder’s  ideological  and  political  stand  on  the  Black  national questioa  Jones  contended  that  Browder’s  line  on  self-determination  was  i4hased  on  a  pious  hope  that  the  struggle  for  <i class="calibre4">fu ll</i> economic, social and political equality for the Negro people would be  ‘legislated’  and  somehow  brought  into  being through  reforms from  on  top.”30  Jones  upheld  the  revolutionary  position  as  “a scientific  principle  that  derives  from  an   <i class="calibre4">objective</i>  condition  and upon this  basis expresses the fundamental demands (land, equality,  and  freedom)  of the  oppressed  Negro  people.”31</p>
<p class="calibre1">The debate began as an important phase of the struggle against Browder. It continued in the clubs, the sections and the districts for over a year. Almost every issue of the  <i class="calibre4">PA</i> from the middle of 1945 </p>
<p class="calibre1">through Decemher  1946, carried an article relating to some aspect of  the  struggle.  Under  the  cover  of  a  ringing  denunciation  of Browderism,  the  right  came  forward  to  continue  his  liquidationist  line on the Black national question and to oppose the right of self-determination.  This  time the banners  were carried  by two college professors—Doxey Wilkerson, a  Black man and formerly a  professor at  Howard  University,  and  Francis Franklin, a white professor  from  the  University  of Virginia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While couched  in  sociological and theoretical jargon and  with constant allusions to “new” developments  in the Black Belt, their arguments  were just  another  rehash of the assimilationist  deviation  on  the  question.  While  opposing  the  right  of  self-determination,  both  Franklin  and  Wilkerson  discussed  the  growing trend toward  integration and disintegration of the Black majority in  the  Black  Belt,  the  breakup  of the  sharecropping system  and semi-feudal  relations  of  agriculture,  to  support  their  arguments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both tended to downplay the role of the national aspirations of Black  people and  to portray the direct integrationist  trend as the only significant aspect of the movement. They totally negated the possibility  of  a  national  revolutionary  upsurge,  that  the  Black liberation struggle would ultimately take an autonomous direction towards political power as a guarantee for equality. Wilkerson and Franklin  failed  to  understand  that  in  the  Black  Belt this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p574"></a><img src="index-574_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">552</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  mean  nothing less  than  the right of self-determination, that is,  the  option  of autonomy,  federation  or secession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin’s analysis was different from earlier liquidators only in that  he  discovered  a  new  dimension  to  the  right  of  self-determination, “the right of amalgamation with the dominant nation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the struggle for unity has always hecn implicit in the right of self-determination,  Franklin  had  something  else  in  mind.  By calling for the “right to  amalgamate,” he was actually advocating the  right to disperse, to disintegrate and  blend  into the rest of the country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Max Weiss, a member of the National Committee and formerly a leader of the YCL, wrote a substantial article refuting Franklin’s line.  In it, he stated what he perceives as Franklin’s meaning: “The right of self-determination  means the right not to be a nation, the right  to  put  an  end  to  its  existence  as  a  nation.”32</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather than seeing it as a question of the masses of Black people fighting for the right to control their destinies, Franklin saw it as a struggle of the national bourgeoisie to control its own  markets.  In a  sort  of  inverted  Jim  Crowism,  Franklin  argues  that  a  Black nation  can  only  develop  under  Jim  Crow  because  that  brings about  the development  of a  separate Black  capitalist class.  “It is this  separate  Negro  capitalism  which  has  formed  the  economic base for the emergence among the Negro people of the Black Belt of  separate  national  characteristics  of  their  own.”33  Clearly,  in Franklin’s estimation, the system of Jim Crow was breaking down, and  this  was  bringing  about  the  elimination  of  the  national bourgeoisie  and,  with  it,  the  possibility  of the development  of a Black  nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilkerson’s line was slick, but even more bankrupt, as, hased on a few token gains, he painted a blissful picture of the uninterrupted progress  of  Black  people  under  imperialism.  Wilkerson’s  perspective on  the  question  is  that the nation  is new and embryonic and  it  is  therefore  possible  for  it  to  develop  in  any  number  of directions.  In  the case  of the  Black  nation,  it  is  going more and more  in  the  direction  of  full  integration  with  Black  people becoming a  national  minority.  Thus  he  states,  “The  perspective for  the  Negro  people  in  the  United  States  is  neither  toward</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p575"></a><img src="index-575_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">553</p>
<p class="calibre1">disintegration  as  a  people nor  toward statehood as a nation;  it  is probably toward  further development as a national minority, as a distinct  and  increasingly  self-conscious  community  of  Negro Americans.”34</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilkerson  went  so  far  as  to  state  that  the  Black  nation  is  too embryonic  even  to  be  conscious  of  its  own  nationhood-  The implication from this being that if Black people don’t demand self government, why should communists do it for them.  In fact, there had  been  strong  waves  of  nationalism  in  the  Black  liberation struggle—the  Garvey  movement, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forty-ninth </p>
<p class="calibre1">Staters </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  Sufis  were  but  a  few  examples.  Wilkerson  would have  been  astounded  to  hear  of the  number  of subject  nations that had even less developed national characteristics, but nevertheless were still afforded the right  of self-determination by communists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  twenties  a  Yugoslavian  communist,  Semich,  had  raised similar arguments  concerning the Croats and Slovenes in his own country.  Stalin  spoke to  Semich’s argument  in a speech entitled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Concerning the National  Question  in  Yugoslavia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1912,  when  we  Russian  M arxists  were  outlining  the first draft  of  the  national  program m e  no  serious  movement  for independence  yet  existed  in  any  o f  the  border  regions of the Russian  Empire.  Nevertheless, we deemed it necessary to include in o u r program m e the point  on the  right of nations to   self-determ ination,  i.e.,  the  right  o f every  nationality  to secede  and  exist  as  an-independent  state.  Why?  Because we based  ourselves  not  only  on  what  existed then,  but  also  on w hat was developing and  impending in the general system of international relations; that is, we took into account not only the  present  but  also  the  future.” 35</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilkerson’s  theories were refuted  in  two well documented and well  formulated  articles  by  James  Allen.36 To  Wilkerson’s  claim that  more  and  more  Blacks  were  leaving  the  Black  Belt,  Allen countered that this  has  been  an historic trend since the end of the Civil  War.  Nevertheless,  the  Black  Belt  was  still  an  area  of Black  majority  and still maintained the remnants of slavery in the sharecropping system.  While Wilkerson contended that the right</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p576"></a><img src="index-576_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">554</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  self-determination  can  only  mean  secession,  Allen  correctly pointed  out that federation and various forms of autonomy were also  encompassed  within  the  right  of self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Linking  the  working  class  struggle  with  the  Black  liberation movement,  Allen stated, “History has taught us, and our present political  experiences  teach  us,  that  every  forward  step  of  tbe progressive  movement,  every  advance toward  the  unity  of white and Negro workers, and every democratic gain...makes self-determination  of the  Negro  people  more  realizable."37</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  had  been doing a lot of study and writing at this time and saw that the Party needed to have a basic program for agrarian reform in  the  Black  Belt;  the  kind  of  program  that  had  been  liquidated with  the  dissolution  of  the  Sharecroppers  Union.  “Toward  a Program of Agrarian  Reforms  for the  Black  Belt,"  a two-artide series, was my contribution to developing such a program.38 Later, much expanded and deepened  in   <i class="calibre4">Negro  Liberation</i>, these articles re-examined  the  agrarian  system  in  the  South  based  on  current data. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The essentia) thesis of the articles was that lying at the root of the oppression  of  Blacks  is  the  unsolved  agrarian  question  in  the South.  The  Southern  plantation  system,  with  its  deeply-rooted semi-feudal  characteristics,  is  being  forcihly  maintained  by  the imperialist  ruling  class  in  alliance  with  the  Southern  oligarchy through the system of Jim Crow laws and lynch terror. It is, in fact, continually  reproducing  Black  inequality  in  all  walks  of  life, condemning Blacks to Jim Crow in the South and throughout the country.  With  a  long range  program  of self government  for  the Black  Belt, the articles also included such immediate demands as reduction of land  rentals,  written contracts between landlord and tenant, and abolition of all laws and practices supporting peonage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The culmination of this intensive period of debate and struggle was  the  restoration  of  the  revolutionary  position  on  the  Afro-American  question.  At  a  National  Committee  plenum  in  December  1946,  the Party adopted  a resolution which reaffirmed its support  of self-determination  for  the  Black  Belt.  This  victory  in great  measure  must  be  attributed  to  the  militancy  and  determination  of the younger comrades wbo played such an important</p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">555</p>
<p class="calibre1">role. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party’s  rededication  to  this  revolutionary  fight  had  particularly  important  consequences  for  work  in  the  South,  which had  been  most  seriously  affected  by  dropping  the  position.  In 1947,  two  years  after  the  Party  was  reconstituted  in the  South, membership was up to 2,000—higher than it had ever been. Cadres began playing a leading role in huilding the fight for equal rights and  in  the  anti-lynching  campaigns,  in  the  trade  unions  and organizing the unorganized. Communists led two important strikes in North Carolina which saw some  17,000 tobacco workers come under union  contract  for the first lime.  Miranda Smith,  a young Black  woman  and  a  member  of  the  Southern  Negro  Youth Conference,  was  an outstanding and  militant  leader in the strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,  she  died  soon  thereafter.39</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  part of the brief upsurge of Party work  in the South was the 1948  Progressive Party campaign in which communists were very active.  Paul  Robeson and  Wallace  made an  unprecedented joint tour  of seven  Southern  states “  loudly  refusing  to  obey the  Jim Crow  laws  governing  meeting,  eating  and  sleeping  places,  and attacking white supremacy head on. The Wallace campaign in the South  was  in  many  ways  a  mass  protest  movement  against segregation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party  memhers  also  helped  build  the  New  Orleans  Youth Conference, an organization of over 500 Black and white youth. It picketed  New  Orleans  stores  in  protest  of discrimination against Blacks  and  integrated  busses and  street  cars  in  defiance  of local laws.  Eventually  the  NOYC  merged  with  the  Southern  Negro Youth  Conference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  spring  and  summer  of  1948,  I  participated  in  two important meetings on the agrarian question. These meetings were valuable because they were part of the struggle to reconstitute the Party  in the South.  I was very enthusiastic about the first of these which was held in Atlanta, because 1 hadn't been in the South since the  thirties.  There  was  still  harsh  Jim  Crow  but  there  was something else afoot. Though I was only there a short time, I could see  it  on  the  streets  - a   part  of  the  general  post-war  upsurge  of Black people,  but with its own special Southern character. Busses</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  still  segregated,  but  Black people no longer waited  until all the whites were on board before they themselves got on. This was a small  step,  but  I  knew  it  wouldn’t  stop there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  meeting,  which  was  attended  mainly  by  Southern cadres, was to summarize some of the past mistakes and begin to draw up a program. It was at tbis meeting that I first learned in some detail of what  had  happened  when  the  SCU  had  been  liquidated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  this,  there  was  another  meeting  in  New  York  to discuss  the  agrarian  question.  At  this  meeting,  1  found  the rightist  tendency  to lump  the special  oppression  of Black  sharecroppers  and  tenants  in  the  South  into  the  more  general  farm question was still prevalent.  1  remember that we held a very long discussion  on this  point  and after considerable struggle,  we were able  to win  the  majority  to  the correct  line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out of these meetings came general agreement with the need for a revolutionary program  of agrarian reform in the South—based on the right of self-determination for the Black nation. As a result of these discussions,  the Agrarian Commission developed  such a program  and  it  was  published  in   <i class="calibre4">Political  Affairs</i>  in  March  of 1949.40  Unfortunately  this  program  was  never  put  into  practice, nor did  it ever take  on  any  organizational  form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In general,  this victory in  the field of Afro-American work was to  be  only  short  lived  as  the  right  opportunist  trend  hovered forebodingly  in  the  wings.  The  main  political  thrust  of  tbe leadership  at  the  time  was  to  build  a  coalition  with  the  forces arrayed  around  the  Truman  Administration.  This  was  merely  a continuation  of the  rightist  united  front  policies  of tbe  Browder period  and  had  important  implications  for the  Party’s  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with  such  a  strong  movement  among the rank  and file, however, the Party leadership was forced to accept  reaffirmation of the  revolutionary  line.  I  strongly suspect  that  their  intentions from  the  beginning were to  subvert  that  line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  evident  in  Dennis’  remarks  at  the  December  1946 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plenum  of  the  National  Committee.  “I  think  we  would  make a serious and harmful mistake if wc were to associate the realization of  the  right  of  self-determination  solely  with  the  realization of socialism  in  the  United  States,”  he  stated.  And  further:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p579"></a><img src="index-579_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">BROWDER'S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">557</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the  American  people,  the lab o r movement in alliance with the  great  Negro  people  and  all  progressive  and  democratic forces,  can  check  and  defeat  the  onslaught  o f  pro-fascist m onopoly  reaction,  and  bring  into  power,  as  an  im portant phase  o f that  struggle,  a  progressive  presidential  ticket  and Congress in  194$, with all that this would entail, many things will be possible, including, at least, trem endous strides toward the full  realization of equal  rights of the Negro people in the Black  Belt.41</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  statement  clearly  cuts  away at  the  revolutionary heart  of the  right  of  self-determination  and  puts  it  in  the  context  of  a program  of electoral  reform.  It  was  a crude attempt  to make the slogan acceptable to the liberal and reformist leaders the Party saw as its allies. It is an utter denigration of the slogan, reducing it to a reformist  character and fostering the illusion that such profound changes  in  the  lives  of the  Black  masses can occur without mass revolutionary  struggle  against  monopoly  capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dennis's position had sounded a little off to me from the start. I felt  all  along  that  he  had  never  agreed  with  the  slogan,  and certainly  1  had  never  heard  him  defend  it  before.  In  the  same speech,  he seemed to be hedging on the question.  It appears to me now  in  looking  back  that  it  was  some  form  of apology  for the period  of backsliding  and  vacillation under  Browder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  manner  that  could  easily  be  used  by  the  right  to justify dropping  the  principle  of self-determination,  Dennis  referred  to past sectarianism in application of the slogan,  as though this had been widespread.42 It’s true that there had been some sectarianism when the  position was first  adopted  in  1928 and then again in the early thirties  when we  had  little practical  experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were those who tried  to decide in advance what the final solution would be for Black people; for instance, Pepper’s demand for a  Negro Soviet  Republic.  But these “left” sectarian errors had never been the main deviations  in  our work.  It seemed to me that Dennis was again trying to  raise a straw man on the left to avoid dealing  with the  main  danger  of right  opportunism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Party leadership had already undertaken the liquidation of left-led centers  in the mass  movement,  and soon after the plenum the  once influential  National Negro Congress was dissolved. The</p>

<p class="calibre1">558</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership  contended  that  Black  comrades  should  move into the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“mainstream  of Negro  life” (as  best represented  hy the NAACP) and  not  become  isolated  in  so-called  sectarian  organizations like  the NNC.43</p>
<p class="calibre1">That  this  was  not  the  view  of  the  majority  of  cadres  was dramatically illustrated to me a couple of years later at an enlarged meeting  of the  National  Negro  Commission  in  New  York.  This meeting was attended by thirty or forty of the Party’s top cadres— </p>
<p class="calibre1">mostly  Black... in  the field  of Afro-American  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  rememher that I made a speech questioning the liquidation of the  NNC  and  calling for the formation of a  left-led  united front organization to take its place.  Paul Robeson, a great human being and an ardent fighter for Black liberation, had just returned from Europe  and  was at the height of his popularity.44 I  reasoned that we  might  take  advantage of Robeson’s acclaim by asking him to head  such  an  organization  and  to  build  a  broad,  mass  based movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Betty  Gannett  and  Pettis  Perry,  representing the leadership at the meeting,  spoke vigorously against this proposal, saying that it was sectarian and that there was no need for another organization among  Black  people.  I  had expected such a response  from them, but  I  was  surprised  by  the  overwhelming  support  my  proposal received from the cadres, especially the young Blacks. They spoke so  forcefully  in  support  of my proposals that Gannett and  Perry had  to retreat, saying that they certainly  would  bring the mattter before  the  national  leadership.  I  don’t know whether or not they did,  hut  this  was  the last  time  I  ever  heard  anything  about  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  important  gains  made  in  the  field,  the  rightist tendency remained very persistent. It expressed itself mainly in the form  of the  “coalition  concept”  and  affected  not  only  the work among  Blacks,  but  all  areas  of  mass  work,  the  trade  unions  in particular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  policy  was  actually  an  extension  of  Browder’s  liquidationist  line  which  was  never  thoroughly  rejected  by  the  new leadership  and  left  the  Party  tailing  the  liberal  and  reformist leaders. </p>

<p class="calibre1">harsh  realities  of  the  cold  war  and  the  attack  on  communism worldwide, but only in the minds and hearts, and the most wishful thinking  of those  who  propounded  it.  The  1945  Reconstitution Resolution states,“TheTruman Administration JiketheRoosevelt government  from  which it  is developing, continues to  receive the support  of  the  Roosevelt-labor-democratic  coalition,  and  responds to various class  pressures.”45 Not only does this reflect the Party’s classic overestimation of the Roosevelt forces in particular, but  also  a  failure  to  understand  the  role  of  such  forces  as representatives  of the  imperialist  class  as  a  whole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Underlying  this  outlook  was  the  “failure  to  recognize  the  realignment of class forces, especially the sharp swing to the right on the part of the top leadership of the CIO and labor generally,” as well as the old line reformist leadership of the N A ACP.46 While the Party remained spellbound  by this line, seemingly oblivious to the world  around  it,  anti-communist  resolutions  were  passed  in  the trade  unions.  So  called  progressive-center  labor  leaders  like Walter  Reuther  and  Phillip  Murray  bolted  with  lightning  speed to  the  side  of  the  imperialists.  The  NAACP  leaders  involved themselves  in  a  vicious red-baiting campaign, as the government began gearing up the machinery for full enforcement of the Smith Act.47  All  such  measures  were  fully  backed  by  the  courts,  the police,  federal  agents  and  all  levels  of government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CLASS  STRUGGLE IN  THE NMU</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  could  see  the  obvious  effects  of  this  policy  in  the  National Maritime Union (NMU).  The cold war realignment of forces was bringing  on  a  crisis  of the  left in  the trade union  movement —a clear  employer-government  drive against communists,  a drive to hreak  up the  left-center  coalition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While this shift  had already begun before the war ended, it was clear that they really meant business at the 1946 CIO Convention in  Atlantic City, when the CIO Declaration of Policy on Communism was passed The statement held that the convention delegates </p>
<p class="calibre1">“resent  and  reject  efforts  of  the  Communist  Party  or  other</p>

<p class="calibre1">political parties and their adherents to interfere in the affairs of the CIO.”4*</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  move  signaled  the  first  round  in  the  post-war  attack, on  the  wages  and  living  standards  of  the  working  class  and was a clear victory for the monopoly capitalists. In fact, there was no organized  opposition  to the right wing block which was led by social  democrats,  Trotskyites,  Christian  Fronters and Coughlinites. The CP delegates also voted for the resolution, while the Party press took  an “it could have been a lot worse” kind of stand. This left  the  masses  of  delegates  a  confused  and  easy  prey  to  the demagogy  of the  right  wing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus  sacrificing  democratic  rights  for  ‘‘unity,”  and  an  independent  stand  for  coalition  at any  price, the  Party suffered  blow after  blow  at  the  hands  of the  Reuthers,  Murrays  and  Currans, When in 1948 it had become clear that the trade union bureaucrats were  unalterably lined  up against the left, the Party halfheartedly tried  to shift gears—calling for a rank-and-file upsurge in support of  the  communists.  But  this  move  was  unsuccessful  in  that  the Party refused—even in the face of vicious reaction—to fully break with  its  policy  of  tailing  the  bureaucrats,  leaving  large sections  of the  rank  and  file  to  become  consolidated  behind  the right-wing leadership  of the unions. The Party refused to play the bold  independent  role  that was necessary if we were to  exert any kind  of leadership  in the labor  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  NMU  was  a  crucial  arena  of  this  struggle.  Built  by  the Communist  Party,  it  was  the  most  left  and  democratic of all  the unions.  Communists  were  in  the  majority  on  the  National Board,  NMU  ships  were  a  school  for  ideological  and  political struggle—not only around the day-to-day issues on the ship, but on the broader political questions as well. Communism, Trotskyism, Stalin and the Black national question were regular topics of mass ideological  debate.  NMU  seamen  had  served  proudly  in  the Spanish  Civil  War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The NMU had  a reputation as the finest, most progressive and democratic union in the country.  Ships crewed by the union were the first in the maritime industry to have checker board (Black and white) crews.  Jesse Gray,  a Black seaman and friend of mine who</p>

<p class="calibre1">561</p>
<p class="calibre1">began  sailing  when  he  was  sixteen  or  seventeen  years  old, described  the general feeling that  Blacks  had  about the union at that  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One thing that was really exciting,..you had to have been in the NMIJ  to  really  feel,  it  was  like another world.  It’s  like  going to China,  to the Soviet  Union on  a trip if you've never been there. If you’ve always lived  in the South in the  U.S.  where racism was so sharp, and to go to the NMU where Blacks and whites were on the ship, they were together, worked together —it was a real big thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  that  was  only  as  a result  of the  sharp struggles of the more advanced political forces.”49 As to the role of Black workers, Jesse said,  “Black  workers  in  particular  gave  leadership  to the  NMU, and arose then as a tremendous,  conscious force—Black workers and their allies were the most powerful bloc on the waterfront.”50</p>
<p class="calibre1">One  would  have  thought  that  we  communists were so  strong that we could never have been driven out of the union. We built it, we  fought  for  it,  but  we  reckoned  without  our  host.  They  had a plan which had been developed over a number of years and which included the use of government training schools to develop cadres of seamen. This  was an organized attempt to create a split among members  in  the  union  with  payoffs  to  right  wingers  and  union thugs.  While  the  Party  vacillated  and  refused  to  take  a  stand against such chicanery, the shipowners and the government scored victory  after  victory.  And  NMU  President  Joseph  Curran  was their  man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curran had been a leader of the union since its founding days in 1936  as  a  militant  split  off  of  the  bureaucratic  and  corrupt Seaman’s  International  Union (SIU),  A rough and tumble sailor whose  home  ashore  had  once  been  Battery  Park,  Curran  had experienced  a  rapid  shift  in  fortunes  since  the  founding  of  the union.  He had once been a militant fighter and before the break up of the left-ccntcr coalition  had been counted among the left in the union. The Party was very slow to understand what was happening and to change its strategy accordingly when Curran began shifting to  the  right  in  late  1945  and  1946. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I noticed this changed atmosphere as soon as I got back on ship in the fall of 1946.  Wc were sailing on the USS   <i class="calibre4">Washington</i>.  She</p>

<p class="calibre1">562</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been a troop ship during the war and had heen reconverted by her owner,  United States Lines, to her old status as trans-Atlantic passenger  liner.  She  traveled  the  New  York-Southampton-Le Havre  route,  sometimes  stopping  at  Cobh,  Ireland,  in  County Cork. It was a sixteen or seventeen day voyage and I stayed with it off and  on  for a  year,  while  I  was writing  my  book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was a  big old  ship, damp  and drafty,  with a crew  of about 700.  Conditions  in  general  were  poor  and  seamen  were  always being injured.  Accommodations  in the crews’ quarters, the  glory hole,  were  unbearable.  Under  such  conditions  there  was  quite naturally  a  good  bit  of struggle on  board.  And  here is where we clearly  saw  the new alignment  of forces—it  was the  rank and  file against  the  Curranites  all  the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curran’s  men  would  faithfully tail the company’s line.  At that time the ship  owners  had a major campaign  to put all their ships under foreign flags in order to enjoy cheap wages and get rid of the union.  This  necessitated  temporarily shutting down a number of ships  which  sailed  under  U.S.  flags.  When  the  company  would threaten  to  take  the   <i class="calibre4">Washington</i>  to  the  ships’  graveyard  up  the Hudson  River,  the  Curran  forces  would  say  that  we  should withdraw all pending grievances or face the  loss of 700jobs. “Save jobs at  all costs,” they said.  We of course oposed this line; as long as  we  had jobs,  we  would  fight  for our rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curran  had  a  willing  and  ready  accomplice  in the  Trotskyite Socialist  Workers  Party.  The   <i class="calibre4">Washington</i>  crew  in  1947  represented for the first time a large concentration of Trotskyitcs and they were clearly out to get the Party.  They thought if they could tail  behind Curran, even get a few places on the Curran slate, they could help in wiping communists out of the industry and emerge as the  sole,  unchallenged,  left  wing  leadership.  The  second  half of their plan was never to come to fruition, but they certainly served the  cause  of Curran  and  the  ship  owners  well Instead of joining us on the basic issues, they firmly took up the collaborationist  policies  of the Curranites in opposing strikes and other  such  actions  in  order to  save johs.  They  became  Curran’s goons.  When the Coast Guard screened all the communists out of the industry,  the Trots were saved—partially in payment for their</p>

<p class="calibre1">563</p>
<p class="calibre1">meritorious  service to the government and  partially  because they represented  no threat  to the  Curran  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the progressive, communist-led left was very strong on that ship.  We  controlled  the  stewards’  department—400  men,  about two-thirds  of whom were Black and  Puerto Rican—and also had strong forces on deck and in the engine room. The right couldn't openly  oppose  us  so  they  had  to  resort  to  more  underhanded tactics.  Often  they  would  use  guys  like  Frank  Ryan  to  try  and infiltrate  our  ranks.  An able-bodied  seaman  and  a  very  capable bastard, he had been around the trade union movement for quite a while and had been port agent in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Ryan was elected  ship's chairman for one voyage of the   <i class="calibre4">Washington. </i>  Later he  became  a  lieutenant  of New  York  City  Transit  Union  boss, Mike  Quill.  As  far as  the  right  was  concerned,  he was a flaming radical; but when it came down to brass tacks, he was just another Curran  man  in disguise.  He caused  a lot  of trouhle,  hut he never fooled  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesse  Gray,  who  was  then  about  twenty-one  years  old,  was chairman of the steward's department and, on one or two voyages, had  been elected ship chairman.  He was a militant organizer and a great  strike  leader  as  I  recall.  Many  years  later  Jesse  and  I reminisced about all the many strikes we had on ship. "We had all the workers joining us and we could tie the ship up in a minute nail it  to the  pier,”  he  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  recall  one occasion when the crew  went  straight to the union hall—right  up  to the  national  board  to  present  their grievances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curran  was there  and,  as could  be expected, opposed  the strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a lot of militant anti-Curran rhetoric, the board nevertheless went along with him and voted against the strike. I remember Jesse talking to the crew after that, he sure didn't want to go along with the  board.  But  the  majority  voted  to  accept  their  decision  and everybody  went  back  to work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The NMU held a convention in October 1947 at the Manhattan Casino.  It  was  a  Curran  sweep  both  locally  and  nationally, accomplished  with the able bodied support of the local police and Curran’s own  henchmen and thugs  in the union.  He would carry his men from port to port, just to vote in and help ‘’supervise” local</p>

<p class="calibre1">elections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A friend of mine tells a story about a seaman meeting a shipmate of his  in New Orleans.  “I thought  you were just  in New York  the other day.  How  did  you  get  down  here so  fast?”  he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  caught  a  fast  freighter,”  was  the terse  reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite this offensive, the left slate whieh was headed by Blackie Myers  and  Ferdinand  Smith,  a  Black  man,  won  15,000  out  of 60,000  votes  nationally.51</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was at the national convention and remember that there were a eouple of dozen  poliee scattered around the hall where the voting took  plaee.  Paddy  wagons  waited  expectantly  on  the  outside.  A police  lieutenant  would  from  time  to time  take  the  microphone and  warn  the  crowd  against  creating  disturbances,  as  brawls between the Curranites and the rank and file broke out all over the room.  Curran  was  at  his demagogie, red-baiting best, foretelling the  dire consequences  of a eommunist  takeover of the union.  He warned  that  the ship  owners  would  never  bargain  with the reds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  this  election,  union  democracy  was  thrown  out  the window. The constitution was rewritten with the bureaucrats now firmly in eharge of what had onee been the most demoeratie union in the country.  The Coast  Guard  began  backing up the attaek on the  left  by  issuing  passes.  It  became  mandatory  for  merchant marines to earry Coast Guard passes  and none were being issued to  militants.  By  the  late  forties,  communists  were  effectively barred  from  shipping out  of any  port  in  the country. </p>

I had met him through Bill Patterson, the two were close friends and Bill had helped bring Robeson into the left progressive movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many tributes have been written about Paul and I knew them all to  be  true.  He  was  a  great  musician,  singer and  actor.  But more importantly,  I  knew him to be a great human being and an ardent</p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S  TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">565</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighter  for  Blaek  rights.  We had  often  diseussed  the  book  I  was working  on.  Robeson was  sympathetic  to  what  I  was  doing and anxious to see the book, the first of its kind by a Black Marxist, in print.  When  Bill  explained  it  would  be  possible  to  finish  the manuscript in a few months if 1 could work full time on it, Paul was more  than  willing  to  subsidize  me,  offering  a  hundred  dollars  a month. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the next few months 1 worked hard on the manuscript. I was very  fortunate  to  have a  good  editor  who  was of invaluable help  to  me  and  a  very  capable  political  consultant  as  well.  The encouragement  of my wife Belle and  other friends was also most important  and  helpful  to  me.  At  the  same  time,  I  was teaching elasses on the Afro-American question at the Jefferson School and Party  training  schools  in  the  district.  I  found  these  tasks  complemented  each  other  nicely.  In  the  classes  I  was  able  to  use material  I  was  working  on  for  the  book.  The  lively  diseussions provided useful  criticisms and the questions helped  to clarify my ideas  and  formulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the fall of 1948 my book,  <i class="calibre4">Negro Liberation, </i> was published.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  received  great  aeelaim  in  the  communist  press,  both  here and abroad,  and  was  published  in  a  number  of languages;  Russian, Polish,  German, Czech and Hungarian.  It eame to be regarded by the Party as a basie text in its field.  Meetings and seminars were set up  which  diseussed  the  book.  Shortly  after  its  publication, I  spoke  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">mass  meetings  in  Detroit,  Ann  Arbor  and Chieago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The position of the book was not new, but a reaffirmation of the revolutionary  position  developed  at  the  Sixth  Comintern  Congress  in  1928.  The  heart  of this  position  is  that  the  problem  is fundamentally a question of an oppressed nation with full rights of self-determination  It emphasized the revolutionary essence of the struggle  for  Black  equality  arising from  the  fact  that  the  special oppression  of Blacks  is  a  main  prop  of the system of imperialist domination  over  the  entire  working  elass  and  the  masses  of exploited  American  people.  Therefore  the  struggle  for  Blaek liberation  is  a  component  part  of  the  struggle  for  proletarian revolution.  It is the historic task of the worki ng class movement, as</p>

<p class="calibre1">566</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">it advances  on the road to socialism, to solve the problem of land and  freedom  of the  Black  masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  was  new  in  the  book  was  the  thorough  analysis  of the concrete conditions of Black people in the post-war period. I made extensive  use  of  population  data;  the  1940  census,  the  1947 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plantation  Count  and  other  sources,  in  order  to  show  that  the present  day  conditions  affirmed  the  essential  correctness  of the position  we had  formulated  years  before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was  very  happy  when  the  book  was  finally  finished  and  in print.  I felt that combined with the positive ideological struggle on the question which resulted in the  1946 resolution, the book laid a solid  foundation for the Party’s future work in the field.  I felt that as  future  crises  developed  and  the  oppression  of  the  masses intensified,  the  Black  movement  for  equality  and  freedom would take a  nationalist direction towards a  struggle for political power  and  some  form  of  self-government.  For  this  reason,  a program  based  on  the  principle  of  self-determination  is  an essential  weapon  in  welding together the  powerful revolutionary alliance  of the  Black  masses  and  the  working class  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  prior to  the  publication  of  <i class="calibre4">Negro  Liberation, </i>  the  Party’s Fourteenth  Convention  was  held  in  New  York  City.  The  convention took place in the midst of a growing reactionary offensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  period  of  mounting  cold  war,  Taft-Hartley  anti-labor legislation,  loyalty  oaths  and  direct  measures  to  illegalize  and destroy the Party. At the same time, every effort was being made to discredit  and  wipe  out  all  progressive  traces  of  New  Deal legislation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sharp  swing  to  the  right  had just  recently  resulted  in  the expulsions of the left from the CIO unions, a crushing defeat for the communists.  At the same time, top leadership sections of the Black reformists were shifting to support  for Truman’s anti-communist campaign  and  imperialist  designs  as  embodied  in  the  Truman Doctrine (early  1947)  and  the  Marshall  Plan (June  1947). </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  if  clearer  indication  of  the  growing  attack  on  the  left generally  and  the  communists  in  particular  were  needed,  the Justice Department provided it with the indictments of almost the entire  Party  leadership.  In  July  1948,  the  entire National  Board</p>

<p class="calibre1">BROWDER’S TREACHERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">567</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  indicted  on  violations  of the  Smith  Act.53</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the setting for the Fourteenth  Party Convention held August  2-6,  1948,  in  New  York.  With  the reactionary  offensive intensifying, the Party clearly needed to make a sober and accurate assessment  of its strengths, of its base of support and its ability to rally the  masses (especially  workers  and  oppressed nationalities) against  the  ruling  class  attack.  Rather  than  do  this,  the  Party leadership sank  further into the illusions of the “grand coalition” </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  had so dominated  their policies since the reconstitution  of the  Party  in  1945. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were of course a great deal of militant sounding phrases to cover the retreat.  Rhetoric ahout heing“the party of socialism,” 54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">building  a  “fighting  Communist  Party”55  and  deepening  “our theoretical understanding of the role of the Party,” 56 was common in  the  speeches  and  reports.  But  underlying  all  of  it  was  the fundamental  rightist  orientation  that placed  a premium  on  being in  the “mainstream”  of the  people’s  coalition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was clearly seen in the grandiose assessment of the Wallace campaign.  Wallace was  not  seen as  representing the advocates of free  enterprise,  non-monopoly  capital,  nor  was  it  understood that  his  campaign  was  the  tail  end  of  the  wartime  progressive coalition, the last breath of the dying liberal reformist movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather,  the  convention’s draft  resolution  portrayed  the  Wallace Party  as  a  powerful  movement  on  the  verge  of  launching  a sweeping attack  on  the  monopolists’ reactionary war-mongering policies. “The formation of this hew party. ..marks the beginning of the end of the two-party system through which Big Business has so long ruled....it  represents  a  permanent  structural force in American  politics.”57</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  obviously  rightist  assessment  is  furthered  by  Dennis’s characterization  of  the  Progressive  Party  as  having  a  strong working  class  base  of  support.  “The  new  Progressive  Party, is becoming a mass people’s party, and already embraces the most active  and  politically  conscious  sections  of  the  new  labor  and people’s  coalition.”58</p>
<p class="calibre1">In work among Blacks, the Party was still in the vise grip of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“coalition concept.” Despite the fact that most of the leadership of</p>

<p class="calibre1">568</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK.  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">the NAACP had swung behind Truman’s anti-communist demagogy  and  launched  a  vicious  red-baiting  campaign,  the  Party pursued  a  policy  of conciliation to  the  reformists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  practice  this  meant  the  liquidation  of any  left-led  organizations.  Speaking  at  the  convention,  Ben  Davis  criticized  “left” </p>
<p class="calibre1">errors which were “reflected...in the failure to give main attention to  aiding  and  supporting  the  NAACP.  This  organization  is  the largest,  most  authoritative,  and  most  representative  among  the Negro  people.  It  must  be assisted  and  built.”59</p>
<p class="calibre1">No  better  example  of  the  Party  leadership’s  inability  to accurately assess  its strength can be seen than Foster’s concluding remarks  in  his  discussion  of  the  upcoming  struggle  to  prevent conviction  of  the  Party’s  indicted  leadership.  “There  are  tremendous powers arrayed against us—the Government, the press, the  trade-union  bureaucratic  leadership,  the  Republican  Party, the Democratic Party, the courts, and all the rest of the machinery of capitalism. But  we have one great force on our side—the great masses  of American  people.”60</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why  was  the  Party  so  divorced  from  reality—so  unable  to accurately assess its position and strength in the working class and oppressed masses and make the necessary steps to defend itself? To do  this would  have  required  a  sharp  break  from the rightist and tailist  policies which  had eroded the Party’s base and influence. It would  require  a  thorough-going  self-criticism  and  struggle  to break the grips of the rightism  which  had been carried over from Browder and  still  remained  strong in  the  new  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  the  Party’s  leadership  was  unable  to  do  for  they  were themselves the  architects  of the  policy.  They  had  short circuited the  emerging rank-and-file struggle against  Browder and  had led the attack which brought the expulsion of the so-called disgruntled left  guilty  of  nothing  more  than  attempting  to  complete  the struggle  against  Browder.  And  now  they  were just  as  fervent  in their refusal  to  re-evaluate  post-war  policies. </p>
