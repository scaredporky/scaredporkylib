<p class="calibre1">Chapter  13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Class  Warfare  in  the  Mines</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  June  1931,  the  TUUL  sent  me  to  Pittsburgh to work as an organizer in a strike led  by the National  Miners  Union (NMU), a TUUL  affiliate.  It  was  the  largest  strike  the  TUUL  had  led up  to  that  point  and  involved  some  42,000  coal  miners  in the  Pittsburgh  area  (eastern  Ohio,  northern  West  Virginia  and western  Pennsylvania),  6,000  of  whom  were  Blacks.  This  strike was a part of the whole upsurge of working class activity led by the Communist  Party  during  this  period.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">The NMU was founded in  1928 by members of the rank-and-file Save-the-Union  Committee  of  the  United  Mine  Workers  of America  (UMWA).  John  Watt  was  elected  president,  William Boyce  vice-president, and Pat Toohey  secretary-treasurer.  When the TUUL  was  formed in  1929, the NMU affiliated with the new revolutionary  labor  organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its founding immediately  followed the defeat of the UM WA in the  bituminous  coal' strike  of  1927,  the  result  of the  reactionary policies  of John  L.  Lewis.  After  a strike which lasted  over a year and  despite the  efforts  of the  Save-the-Union  Committee,  Lewis signed a separate agreement for the Illinois district. This move left the men in the Pittsburgh area with  nothing  to do but go back to work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost  overnight all  the gains of the past thirty years of bitter struggle against the mine operators had been wiped out. Splits and dual unions developed throughout the minefields where the union</p>

<p class="calibre1">CLASS  WARFARE  IN  THE  MINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">365</p>
<p class="calibre1">had once been strong.  Conditions  of the miners deteriorated very rapidly.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon  arriving  in  Pittsburgh,  I  proceeded  immediately  to the Yugoslav  Hall  where  a meeting of the Central  Strike Committee was proceeding.  Representatives  from ail fields  had assemhled to vote  on  the  strike  and  issue the  general  strike  call.  Foster,  Jack Johnstone,  Alfred  Wagenknccht  and  Jack  Stachel,  from  the national  TUUL  office,  were  all  there  and  all  spoke.  But  most impressive to me were the speeches of the organizers from the coal fields. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ike Hawkins, veteran Black miner whom 1 had met as a delegate to  the  Fifth  RILU  Congress,  and  Tom  Meyerscough,  who  had made  the  “cold  turkey”  speech  at  the  American  Commission  of the Comintern  in  early  1929, spoke of the miserable conditions in the coal fields and the determination of the miners to fight back. It was a fight for  survival dramatically reflected in the strike slogan </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fight Against Starvation!” To this the miners added another, “As Well  Starve  Fighting  as  to  Starve  Working  in  the  Mines!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was assigned as union organizer to the Pricedale region, ahout thirty  miles south of Pittsburgh.  The region included some of the largest  mines  of the Pittsburgh Coal Company, the biggest  of all the coal companies.  1 arrived in town on a late Sunday afternoon in the  midst  of a  hig  open  air  meeting.  It  seemed that the whole town had turned out.  I was delighted to find my friend Bill Dunne there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  arrived  that  morning  and  was  one  of the  few  leaders whom  I  had not  seen  at the Central Strike Committee meeting in Pittsburgh.  He had been sent on a  tour of the fields to pep up the morale of the strikers. A veteran of the copper miners’ struggles in Butte,  Montana, and of the coal miners’ strike in Illinois, he was a skilled orator who was able to speak authoritatively on the issues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I,  on the other hand,  knew nothing of the  mining industry. On the train down from Pittsburgh, I had carefully read the strike call, acquainted  myself with the miners’ vernacular and committed the demands to memory. These included an increase in pay, the eight-hour  day  and  recognition  of the  NMU. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was introduced hy Cutt Grant, the chairman of the local strike</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p388"></a><img src="index-388_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">366</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">committee.  I  repeated verbatim  what  I  had learned from the call and  summarized  the  discussion  of  the  strike  committee  in Pittsburgh.  My remarks were on the whole well received. But I had quickly noticed that only a few Black miners were at the meeting. I had been informed that the Pricedalc Mine had a large Black force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where were  they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  that while  Blacks were the backbone of the strike in the  immediate  areas  around  Pittsburgh  (Library,  for  example), they had not responded well to the strike in this region. I was later to learn  from some Black miners that the prohahle cause for this was  that  Blacks  around  Pittsburgh had come up  from the South earlier.  They  were older  in  the mines and  had  become fairly well integrated into the mine force.  Many had obtained official posts in the  NMU  locals.  This  had  its  ironical  side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  many  locals  Blacks  worked  with  recent  European  immigrants.  In some places the latter were even the majority. But Blacks were  elected  to  union  positions—president,  vice-president  or secretary—because  they  were  the  only  ones  who  could  speak English!  In  Pricedale,  however,  Blacks  had  come  into the mines later,  most  of them  brought  in  as strikebreakers,  as late as  1927. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against this background, the difficulties that confronted me as a union  leader  in  the  area  were  obvious.  I,  a  Black  man,  found myself  the  leader  of  a  mass  of  white  miners  with  strong  racial prejudices. They  didn’t understand why the Blacks had not come out  on  strike.  They  seemed  to  expect  that  Black  miners  should forget about racist incidents that occured duringthelast strike, job discrimination  in  the  mines  and  segregation  in  the  company patches (areas where the mines built company-owned housing and company  stores). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cutt  Grant,  a  slightly  built  wiry  figure,  was  a  strong  and courageous  fighter  of many  mine  battles  and a recognized  rank-and-file  leader.  He  was  also  afflicted  with  the  white  chauvinist illness.  1  remember  how  his  face  fell  when  I  stepped  on  the platform  and  Bill  Dunne introduced  me  as the  NMU  organizer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a sharp contrast  between his enthusiastic introduction of Dunne  and  his apologetic  tone in  introducing  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I must say, however, the attitude of the white miners was cordial</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p389"></a><img src="index-389_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">CLASS  WARFARE  IN  THE  MINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">367</p>
<p class="calibre1">nnd  even  friendly  to  me.  I  was  a “Union  Nigger”  and  therefore different from their Black  fellow miners.  But I overheard mutter-ings, “Why don’t those damn niggers come out?” And I  knew that they expected  me to do something about getting them out.  It was my  first  experience  in  such a  situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  sizable  number  of  South  Slavs  in  the  area, including Adam Getto, a young second generation American, who was  the  Party  organizer.  He  immediately  took  me  in  tow, introduced me to his father,  mother, aunts and cousins.  While the elderly  Slavs  spoke  little  or  no  English,  we  were  able  to  communicate as I spoke  Russian to them  and they spoke Croatian to me,  a  kindred  Slav tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 soon became known throughout the area as the Black Slav.  It felt good to know I had some sort of a base—however tenuous—in the Yugoslav community, which included a sizable number of the miners  in  the  area.  The  ethnic  picture  in  my  section  included  a minority  of  Anglo-Irish (old  timers in the mines,  many of whom had  come from  the South), a sizable number of South Slavs and llic  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  became  immersed  in  the work  of the strike.  Our  immediate larget was to close down the Pricedale Mine. Everyday there were picket lines.  Finally we called a special day. Every shop in the town dosed; all the small merchants turned out for the picket line. The line was led by Cutt Grant, Getto and myself. The state police were also  out  in  force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘T hey were a hardbitten lot—each looked like a one-man army with 30-30 Springfield rifles in their saddle holsters, .45 colts, long riot clubs  and  helmets.  I sized them up as ex-Marines and former Army  noncoms.  As  I  passed  by,  I  overheard  the corporal  say to one of his men, “See that nigger there—he’s the union leader. Keep tin  eye on  him!”—trying to  scare  me  off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition  to  the  state  police,  there  were  the  Coal  and  Iron Police, private cops employed by the coal companies. They carried on  a campaign  of terror in the company patches and around  the mines.  Just  a  few  days  hefore  I  arrived,  they  had  smashed  a picket  line  at  Pricedale  using  tear  gas,  clubs  and  machine  guns, llirce  miners  were  shot.  It  was  the  “worst  rioting  in  Western</p>

<p class="calibre1">368</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pennsylvania  bituminous  fields  in  nine  years.”3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Black miners were not responding to our organizing efforts, however, and the Pricedale Mine stayed open. It occurred to me that I  might use the Scottsboro  issue as a handle.  I talked it over with Getto  and  Grant,  suggesting  that  a  meeting  supporting  the Scottsboro  Defense  be  called  jointly  by  the  National  Miners Union and the League of Struggle for Negro Rights. There was no LSNR  in the field,  but  I felt that as national secretary,  I  had  the authority to  use the  name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I suggested wc try to get hold of the ILD’s famous Black orator, Richard  B.  Moore,  who was touring the country on behalf of the Scottsboro  Boys.  I  also suggested  we issue a special leaflet to the Black  miners,  advertising  the  meeting,  asking them to come out and  hear the latest on the Scottsboro  Boys.  They agreed, and we put  out  a leaflet  which  also  included  the  special demands  of the Black  miners  against  discrimination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The meeting was held on a hot Sunday afternoon, under a large tree i n Fairdale, a neighboring town where our strike headquarters were set up. Several thousand people—miners and their families— </p>
<p class="calibre1">turned out, and for the first time Black faces were among them. It seemed  the entire  Black community had  come  out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard  B.  Moore was at his best; he spoke for over two hours about  the  international  situation,  the  crisis,  unemployment, Scottsboro and the miners’ strike.  He linked them all up together and  was  frequently  interrupted  by  applause,  as  his  ideas  struck home with the audience. He ended with a rousing plea for unity of Black and white miners in the strike. People were just spellbound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cutt Grant came over to me,  eyes moist with emotion. He could hardly  speak.  “My!  I’ve never  heard  a speaker  like that before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moore’s  speech  seemed  to  have  purged  Grant  of  his  white chauvinism.  I  believe  he joined  the  Party  the  next  day,  and  the Black  miners  at  Pricedale joined  the strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MURDER  IN  THE  COALFIELDS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every weekend Getto and I would  go to Pittsburgh to attend a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a><img src="index-391_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">CLASS  WARFARE  IN  THE  MINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">369</p>
<p class="calibre1">Central  Strike  Committee  meeting.  Often  Cutt  Grant  would accompany  us.  Organizers  from  all  the  fields  would  be  present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d  get  tbe  latest  news  of the  strike,  how  it  was  proceeding in other fields, report our own situation and receive new instructions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  would  communicate  this  to  the  miners  in  our region  on  our return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning  one  Monday  morning,  I  crossed  the  bridge  at Monessen,  and was  met  by some  miners from my section.  “Have you  heard  what  happened?”  they said,  rushing  up  to  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They informed me that the company goons—tbe Coal and Iron Police—killed  Filipovich right on his front porch,  with his whole family watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was  shocked.  Filipovich was an ex-miner who had  become a small  storekeeper.  His  store  was  right  across  the  street  from the Pricedale  company  patch.  He  and  his  wife  and  several  children lived  above the  store  and  we had  our miners’  relief station  in  his basement.  Everyone knew him as a strong partisan of the miners and he was well liked  by all,  except the company thugs who were out  to  get  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  proceeded  to  Fairdalc,  but  could  only  get  within  several blocks of the store. There were crowds of miners and their families milling  around  and  I  found  out  exactly  what  had  happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filipovich  and  his  family  had  been  sitting  on  their  porch  the evening before when some company thugs had come out and fired point blank at him  from the company patch  across the street.  He had jumped  up and rushed his family through the door, shouting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t kill the children!” It was then that he was shot, though none of his  children were  hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reaction was tremendous anger throughout the coalfields at this  cold  blooded  murder.  At  the funeral,  miners,  their families and  sympathizers  gathered  from  all  the  coal  fields  around.  A Yugoslav  priest  conducted  the  service  and  Adam Getto  gave the eulogy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The anger of the people was so strong, it was clear the operators couldn’t get away with it this time. The state prosecutor was forced to try the case; the killers were found guilty and sentenced to long prison terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a><img src="index-392_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">370</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  last  hold-out  mines in our area were two near Bentlyville, Charleroi and  Hillman.  They  were  situated  on  a  hill  outside the town limits, just off a public highway. Every time we had attempted to  picket  these  mines,  the  coal  and  iron  thugs  would  mount machine guns across the road, thus blocking our attempts to close them  down.  We all  knew this crude violation of the rights  of the miners could  only take place with the collusion of the state police who were curiously ahsent  on such occasions. Over several weeks we  planned  and  organized  for  an  attack  to  break  through  this blockade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the  help  of the  Central  Strike  Committee,  we  mobilized miners  from  neighboring  coal  fields for a march on these  mines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  morning  of the  march thousands  of miners  and  their wives assembled  at the foot of the hill leading up to the mines. The coal and  iron  thugs  had  placed  across  the  road  three  machine  guns, which glistened  in the morning sun. Cutt Grant, Getto and myself were  to  lead  the  march. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  we  were  gathering,  the  state  police,  who  had  been conspicuously ahsent  in  past confrontations  with gunmen,  made their appearance in the person of a young lieutenant and a sergeant who drove  up  in  a car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing  on  the  running  board,  the  lieutenant  warned  us: </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  march  up that  hill,  you’ll  all  he killed.  Don’t  follow your leaders,”  he  said,  pointing  at  Adam,  Cutt  and  me.  “They  are Russian communists,  trying to  lead  you  into  a trap.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voices  from  the  crowd  responded,  “Isn’t  this  a  public  road? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  right have they to hlock it? Why don’t you clear them off it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s  march,”  they  shouted.  The crowd  surged  forth,  with  Cutt, Getto  and  myself in  the  lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here I am,” I thought, “over the top again, but in another kind of war this  time—against  the enemy  at  home.”  No  weapons,  no artillery support; just militant and determined miners.  Some had clubs,  others picked up rocks, and a few,  I’m sure, had handguns concealed  under  their  coats,  despite  our  efforts  to  discourage them.  So we began the march slowly up the hill, expecting at any moment to be blown apart by the company thugs who now had the three  machine  guns  pointing directly  at  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a><img src="index-393_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">CLASS  WARFARE  IN  THE  MINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">371</p>
<p class="calibre1">The atmosphere was tense with expectancy.  We got ahout fifty fret  from  them,  when  they  suddenly  picked  up  their  guns  and moved them to the side of the road, back onto company property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  had all  been a hluff.  We surged  past  with a deafening “hurrah” </p>
<p class="calibre1">nihI  established  our picket  lines on  the public road  in front of the mines.  Bentlyville mines were struck that day.  Now, all the mines In  our  section  were  on  strike.  The  mines  were  closed  tight  for several months, during which the miners had excellent morale and lighting spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  back-to-work  movement started  slowly in the fourth month of the  strike.  At  first,  it was scarcely  perceptible,  but when more nihI  more  miners  failed  to  show  up  at  local  strike  committee meetings,  it  was clear that demoralization was setting in.  Behind this  was  the  stark  fact  of  starvation  for  the  miners  and  their families.  The  relief  efforts  headed  by  Wagenknecht  were  inadequate to  maintain  a long  drawn-out  strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(ictto,  an  old  hand  in  the  minefields,  warned  me  of what  to expect.  As the feeling that the strike is being lost grows, it is often accompanied  by terroristic actions, particularly among the young miners—blowing  up  tipples,  wrecking  property  and  buildings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We organizers and some of the more militant miners, however, were  reluctant  to admit  defeat.  At  the  beginning  of the back-to-work  movement,  many  rank-and-file  leaders  and  even  union organizers  continued  to  give  rosy  reports  at  the  Central  Strike (  ommittce  meetings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, a few scabs are crawling back, hut the main mass of miners nrc  solid  in  support  of the  strike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the Comintern representative, the German Ewart, appeared at a meeting of the communist fraction of the strike committee.4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  recall,  he kept insisting on exact information on the back-to-work movement.  Clearly, he was suspicious of the glowing reports from  many comrades.  He stressed that if the trend  was there and growing,  that  we  must  be prepared  for a  “strategic  retreat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Retreat! </i>  Such  a  word  was  strictly  taboo.  Some  organizers looked at  bim as though he were a scah  and  argued, “That’s just what the  operators  would  like  us to do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  Foster  seemed  unfamiliar  with  the  idea  of  voluntary</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p394"></a><img src="index-394_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">372</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">retreat. The term was evidently not in his lexicon of strike strategy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If we are facing defeat,  we should  go down fighting—this seemed to  be the common opinion.  But  Ewart quickly pointed out that if we chose this course, we would find all our militants outside of the mines,  blacklisted,  and  our  union  destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, if we recognized our defeat, understood that the miners simply could not stay out any longer, we w'ould be able to  keep  our  militants  in  the  mines,  prevent  ourselves  from becoming isolated, and regroup our forces to fight again. The logic of  this  position  was  unassailable  and  after  several  meetings  we were  won  over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We returned to the fields and called meetings of the strikers. The position  made  sense  to them.  But our action was not taken soon enough.  Thousands  of our  best  miners  had  already  been  locked out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">„  But  the  rank-and-file  movement  among  miners  did  not  end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Early  in  1932,  8,000  miners  in  the  Kentucky  fields  went  out under  the  leadership  of  the  NMU.  This  historic  strike  was carried  out  under  conditions  of  guerrilla  warfare.  After  bitter struggle,  in  which  many  were  killed,  this  strike  was  also broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SUMMATION OF  THE  STRIKE</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  twelve-week  miners  strike  ended  in  a  defeat  for  the workers.  The  failure  of  the  Party,  and  especially  Party  leadership,  to  summarize the strike  and  thoroughly  master the lessons learned  from  it,  contributed  to  the  demise  of the  NMU,  a  red trade  union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  strike  was  carried  out  at a  time when the  mining industry itself  was  in  the  throes  of  deep  crisis,  mass  unemployment prevailed and starvation was an immediate reality for thousands of miners and  class fighters. The economic crisis was nationwide but the mining regions of western Pennsylvania were particularly hard hit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a><img src="index-395_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">CLASS  WARFARE  IN  THE  MINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">373</p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  resolution  of  the  ECCI  summarized  it,  under  these conditions  the  Party  should  have  been  feverishly  working  to prepare  for the miners' strike,  building local organizations  of the Party  and of the red trade unions.5 Some effort was made in this direction  immediately  before  the  strike,  but  on  the  whole,  the Party  organization  was  in  a  weak  and  neglected  state when  the strike  did  break  out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  situation  was  aggravated  by  the  fact  that  after the  strike began,  our  leadership  was  unaware  of the  necessity  and  importance  of  strengthening,  extending  and  building  local  Party  and trade  union  organizations  as  the  backbone  of successful  strike strategy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many leading comrades were brought  in  to aid  in the struggle, but  mainly the higher levels of the strike apparatus were strengthened, while the local levels were almost entirely neglected. Because the strike leadership did not  make the building of local organizations an  urgent priority, it did  not realize that we were in danger of becoming  isolated  from  the  broad  masses  of strikers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Underlying these mistakes was a lack of clarity on the basic line guiding the Party's work in this struggle. The key obstacle was the inability  to  link  up  the  task  of  developing  the  Party  with  the no  less  urgent  task  of  doing  everything  possible  to  win  the miners' strike. Our work during the strike suffered from separating these  tasks and emphasizing one at the expense of the other. Our main  objective,  simply  put,  was  to  revolutionize  the  striking miners-  to  show,  by  our  actions  in  the  strike,  and  through propaganda  and  agitation,  that  it  is  the  communists  who  advocated  and  carried  through the  correct  strike strategy and tactics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Material  success is not always possible in a strike  and is not an absolute  prerequisite  for  determining  the  success  or failure  of a strike.  At  the same time, it must never be forgotten that there can be no political success in a strike without a serious struggle for the material improvement of the strikers. The strike leadership did not sec it was pursuing an entirely one-sided course when it insisted on </p>
<p class="calibre1">“holding  out  to the  last  man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The result of these errors was the failure of the strike committee to lead an orderly and well organized retreat. The strike committee</p>

<p class="calibre1">374</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  not linked  closely  enough  with the miners in the fields.  This close  and  intimate  connection  was  one  thing  that  would  have enabled  the leadership to take measures in sufficiently good time to  prepare  for  the  possibility  of a  strategic  retreat.  Instead,  the leaders  continued  to  listen  to  the  optimistic  and  honey-coated reports of its traveling representatives and discouraged rank-and-file  miners  from  expressing  their  doubts  about  continuing  the strike by labeling all such  miners as scabs. This existed to such an extent that the strike leadership did not even notice that at the end of  the  strike,  we  were  “leading"  a  minority  of  the  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  end,  the  miners  simply  could  not  stay  out  any  longer because of the widespread starvation and police terror. The Party’s refusal  to  organize  for the possibility of a retreat  left us isolated, and  to  a  certain  extent  discredited.  Thousands  of  the  most militant  and  courageous fighters were locked out (blacklisted and evicted)  by  the  coal  operators.  The  NMU  was decimated  by  the coal operators, and thenceforward, we were unable to build it into a  powerful,  independent  union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">LEADING  THE  PARTY’S  AFRO-AMERICAN  WORK</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  returned  to  New  York  from  the  miners*  strike  in  September 1931.  Shortly thereafter,  I  was coopted to the Central Committee with the privilege of sitting in on  meetings of the Politburo.  B.D, Amis, the former head  of the Negro Department, was sent to Ohio and I  was named to fill his position. In my new job, a large part of my  time  was  devoted  to  the  Scottsboro  campaign,  which  was a major  effort  of the  Party  in the  Black  liberation  struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is difficult to fully assess the tremendous impact Scottsboro had on the Party’s political development in that period. Every area of  work—every  mass  organization  we  were  involved  in—was strengthened  by  our  participation  in  tbis  defense  campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through  our  militant  working  class  policy,  we  were  able  to  win workers of all nationalities to take up the special demands of Black people embodied  in the Scottsboro defense.  Fll  never forget  how the  immigrant  workers  in  the  Needle  Trades  Union  would  sing</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Scottsboro  Boys  Shall  Not  Die”  in their  various  Eastern  European  and  Yiddish  accents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  South,  the  movement  awakened  the  great  mass  of the Black  peasantry  and  resulted  in  the  building  of  the  militant Sharecroppers Union, which embraced thousands of land-starved Black croppers and poor farmers.  Scottsboro helped pave the way for  the  growth  of  the  Unemployed  Councils  and  the  CIO.  The International  Labor  Defense (TLD),  which  had  been initiated  by </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">[</i> he Party in  1925 to fight for the freedom of political prisoners like lom  Mooney  and  Warren  Billings,  became  the  main  mass organization  in  Scottsboro.6 The  Mooney case and others like it were linked  to the Scottsboro frame-up and became instrumental in  winning  white  workers  to  the  fight  for  the  freedom  of  the Scottsboro  Boys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottsboro marked  the first real bid  of the Party and the Black working  class  for  leadership  in  the  Black  liberation  struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within the national  movement,  Black workers emerged as a force independent  of  the  reformists  and  greatly  strengthened  by  their role as part  of the working class generally. By the end of 1931, we had effectively won hegemony in the defense efforts. Although the NAACP  did  not  formally  withdraw  from  tbe  defense  until January  1932,  we  were already in  de facto control,  the boys and their  parents  having signed  up  with  the  ILD. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  thrust  of  our  policy,  emphasizing  the  primacy  of  mass struggle  for  the  freedom  of  the  boys,  had  succeeded  to  a  large extent  in discrediting and  isolating the reformist-1 iheral NAACP </p>
<p class="calibre1">leadership.  This  fact,  however,  did  not  mean  that  the  right reformist  danger  of  compromise  and  capitulation  in  the  Black freedom  movement  had  been  eliminated.  On  the  contrary,  its proponents  continued  to probe our positions seeking weak spots which  they  could  exploit  to stage  a comeback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  the  Party,  these  influences were reflected in the underestimation of the objective class role of the reformist leadership as an  agency  of tbe  white  ruling  class within  the  Black  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Underlying this was the tendency to ignore class differences in the Black community,  the naive and anti-Marxist assumption that all Blacks  as  members  of  art  oppressed  nation  were  revolutionary</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">or  potentially  so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  attitude  persisted  despite  the  treachery  of  the  NAACP </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaders in the Scottsboro struggle.  In practice, it was manifested in the tendency to rely on local Black leaders, particularly the clergy, in the building of local united fronts and  tbe failure to involve tbe masses below. Often within these united fronts  the Party failed to place elementary conditions for struggle against the ruling class as the  basis  for  unity  and  thus  failed  to  maintain the  independent role  of the  Party,  its  freedom  of action  and  propaganda. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This struggle against the right reformist danger was often made more  difficult  by  left  sectarian errors,  manifested  primarily  in a resistance  to  building the  broadest  possible  united  front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  head of the Negro Department,  I  felt  it  was my job to push the  fight  against  reformism  in  the  Black  community  and  its reflections in  the  Party.  This  I  felt  was  essential,  not  only to the Scottsboro  struggle,  but  also  to  secure  our  long-term  strategic objective,  winning  of  the  hegemony  of  Black  workers  in  the liberation  struggle.  I  pursued  this  line  in  speeches,  lectures,  in training  classes  for  Party  cadres,  and  in  my  writings  during this period.7</p>
<p class="calibre1">In those days the South was considered the main concentration point  for the development  of the Black liberation movement.  As head  of the  national  Negro  Department and  Central  Committee representative to  the  South,  I  was  expected  to follow closely  the development  of the  Party’s work  in that region.  It  was therefore necessary to acquaint myself with its practical as well as theoretical problems.  My  plan was  to  spend  at  least three or four months a year  in  the  South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  first  trip  South  was  to  Charlotte,  North  Carolina,  in  the spring  of  1932.  Charlotte,  located  near  the  foothills  of  the Piedmont,  was  the  geographical  center  of the growing Southern textile  industry.  The  industry  had  grown  up  as  the  result  of the runaway  shops  from  New  England—bent  on  tapping  the  cheap labor supply of poverty-stricken white farmers fleeing the uplands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gastonia,  the  scene  of  the  historic  strike  in  the  spring  of  1929, which had  been led by the Party and TUUL, was only twenty miles from  Charlotte. </p>

<p class="calibre1">377</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charlotte  was  also  the  headquarters  of  the  Party’s  North C itrolina  District.  At  the  time  of my visit,  it was quiet,  but there wrrc  stirrings  in  the  mills  around  the  area,  rumblings  of a  new wave  of  strikes  which  were  to  break  out  the  following  July. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unemployment was  the  main  issue among both  Black and  white workers.  Unemployment was growing as a  result  of the inhuman </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nirctch-out” (speed-up) system. Blacks were still a minority in the mills, working only in dean-up jobs, sweeping and janitorial work. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I*hc  Party  had  carried  through  some  demonstrations  for unemployment  relief.  Some  of  the  stalwarts  from  the  Gastonia nl like  who  had  been  locked  out  of  the  mills  had  moved  into </p>

The  Party had  won sympathy among Blacks as  a  result  of the Scottsboro  issue and its strong position against discrimination in  the shops.  An 1LD  branch  had  been set  up and lhere  was  a  good  Scottsboro  movement in tow a ITie Party was  partially underground, and its members worked in the Unemployed Councils, ILD and the National Textile Union (which had never really recovered after the Gastonia defeat). There was  an unemployed  headquarters  downtown  which  consisted  of II n office and  a fairly  large hall where the ILD also held meetings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party  meetings  were  generally  small  and  held  in  the  homes  of comrades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the top Party leadership was from the north. Richards, the  district  organizer,  was  of  Finnish-American  extraction  and hailed  from  Wisconsin,  where  he  had  formerly  been  D  O.  Amy Schecter was a Jewish cockney.  Born in London, she was a college educated intellectual, but she still retained a thick cockney accent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was one of the original Gastonia Seven who were charged with (he murder of the chief of police. (Their case was finally won in the Supreme Court.) There was also Dave Doran of the YCL. He later became political commissar of the Lincoln Brigade and was killed on the Aragon front in Spain. The outstanding local comrade was ii  steadfast  Black  woman,  Ann  Withers. </p>
