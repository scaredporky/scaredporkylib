<p class="calibre1">1 arrived in New York in early November 1930.  After four and a half years  in  the  Soviet  Union,  everything seemed  quite strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While passing through customs 1 lit up a cigarette, A cop snarled at me out of the comer of his mouth, "No smoking here, fella.” 1 was so  startled  by  his  rude tone that the cigarette  dropped  from my lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out  in  the  street  1  caught  a  taxi  to  the  national  office  of the Party,  which  was then  located  on  East  125th  Street  in  Harlem.  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">looked  at  the  people  along the  way.  Despair seemed  written  on their faces; I don’t believe 1 saw a smile all the way uptown. What a contrast  to  the  gay  and  laughing  crowds  in  Moscow  and  Leningrad!  1  had  arrived  in  the  first year of the Great  Depression;  my own  depression  deepened  as  we  drove  through  Harlem.  I  was overwhelmed  by  Harlem’s  shabbiness  and  the  expression  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">WHITE CHAUVINISM  UNDER  FIRE</p>
<p class="calibre1">343</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopelessness  on  the  faces  of the  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving at the office, I was greeted by Earl Browder and my old friend  Bob  Minor.  They  introduced  me  to Jack  Stachel,  a Party leader  and  national  organizer  for  the  TUUL;  and  Ben  Amis,  a Black  comrade  who was  then in  charge of Afro-American  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  four  men  were  discussing  last  minute  plans  for  the  Anti-Lynching  Conference  called  by  the  American  Negro  Labor Congress.  It was to be held in St.  Louis  on November 15, a couple days  later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Party’s plan, as I gathered, was to use this occasion to launch a  new  organization—the  League  of  Struggle  for  Negro  Rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This new organization was to  replace the now practically defunct ANLC  which  had  proved  inadequate  and  sectarian.  The  ANLC </p>
<p class="calibre1">had been the subject of sharp criticism as early as the Sixth World Congress  in  1928. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  idea  of  the  new  organization  had  been  discussed  at  the Party’s convention in July. There had also been some discussion at the  Negro  Commission  in  the  Comintern.  The  LSNR  was conceived as  the  nucleus  of a  united  front  movement around the Party’s  program  for  Black  liberation.  The   <i class="calibre4">Liberator</i>  was  to  be carried over from the ANLC as the official publication of the new organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After greeting me, the comrades continued the discussion. 1 was just in time to participate in the conference and was given the task of writing  a  draft  manifesto  and  program  for  the  LSNR.  I  was asked if I had anything to say.  I expressed happiness at being back home after such a long absence, and said that I would do my best to carry out the new responsibility. I was also happy to hear about the expected  Southern  delegation  to  the conference,  which reflected Party work  in the South, and made some remarks about the need for an  agrarian  program  for the  Blacks  in  the  South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I noticed that  as  1 spoke some of the comrades were looking at me curiously, as  if puzzled or amused,  1 wondered about it at the time,  but  I  was  to find  out  why  only after the  meeting.  The YCI representative,  a  young  Russian  who  had  been  sitting  in  on  the meeting,  said, “Harry, you’ve  got a strong Russian accent in your English! If I’d not  been looking directly at you I would have sworn</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  Russian  immigrant  was  speaking.” Of course,  1  reflected;  I had  been unconsciously rolling my  V s,” a habit that was to stick with  me  for  many  years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  traveled to St.  Louis via Detroit  and Chicago,  in order to see my  family—my  three  aunts,  of whom  I  was very fond,  my sister Eppa, and nephew David.  I chose to travel by bus in order to get a close  up  look  at  the  country  and  the  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  blight  of  unemployment  and  hunger  was  evident  everywhere.  It  gave  the  lie  to  Hoover’s  slogan  of ‘‘prosperity  is  right around  the  comer.”  People  on  the  bus were friendly and  related their experiences. They seemed hopeless and confused, regarding the  Depression  as  some  sort  of  “natural  disaster.”  They  complained  about  inadequate  relief  and  evictions.  From  the  bus windows  1  could  see  Hoovervilles  on  the  outskirts  of  many towns—vacant  lot  communities  of shacks,  made from discarded boards and  boxes  and  inhabited  by  homeless  families. </p>
<p class="calibre1">T stopped  over  in  Detroit  to  see  Clarence  Hathaway,  my  old Lenin  School  friend,  who  was  then  district  organizer.  We  went into  a  restaurant  downtown  on  Woodward,  a  couple  of  blocks from  the  Party  office.  We  both  ordered  ham  and  eggs  and  after waiting for what seemed an interminable  period,  our orders were finally brought to the table. I started to eat, but gagged and spit out the first  mouthful  on  my  plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  the  matter?”  Clarence  asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This stuff is  as  salty  as  brine!”  I  said  in amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?” he said incredulously. “Mine seems to be all right.” He tasted  some  of  mine  and  immediately  spat  it out, then called  the waiter  indignantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the  matter?”  the  waiter asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  friend’s  food  is so  salty  it’s  inedible ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The waiter, with an evil leer, said, “Well, that’s the best we can do,”  and  walked  away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  only  then  that  it  struck  me  that  this  was  their  way  of discouraging Black patronage.  I’d been out of the country so long that I’d forgotten a lot of these things. Clarence and I stalked out of the restaurant, and there was a silence between us.  He said, “Let’s go  to  another  restaurant  in the  Black  neighborhood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p353"></a><img src="index-353_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">WHITE CHAUVINISM  UNDER  FIRE</p>
<p class="calibre1">345</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  not  hungry  now,  Fve  lost  my  appetite.”  I  replied.  “Clarence, this is your district, you know. You’ve sure got a lot of work to  do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I got the bus to Chicago, still angry, and in this mood wrote the first  draft  of  the  manifesto  and  program  of  the  conference.  I poured all  my anger into the resolution and the whole thing came together very  quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I arrived in Chicago. This great industrial center was hard hit by the crisis, with  plants and  mills partially closed.  There was as yet no  public  welfare,  only soup lines and  private relief.  Blacks were hardest  hit  of alL</p>
<p class="calibre1">My  elderly  aunts,  respectable  law-abiding  people  and  deeply religious,  were forced to sell moonshine whiskey in order to make ends meet.  They told  me this in an apologetic, shamefaced way— </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everybody’s got to do something to get by.” This really got to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  called  on  old  friends and  they  all  wanted  to know about  my experiences  in  the  Soviet  Union.  I  was  interviewed  by  Lucius Harper  of  the   <i class="calibre4">Chicago  Defender</i>  who  was  an  old  friend  of  the family.  1  don’t  remember  if  the  interview  was  ever  published, because  I  left  right  afterwards for St.  Louis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  arrived  in St.  Louis  on November  15,  the opening day of the conference,  and  met  up  with  Otto  who  was  a  delegate  to  the meeting.  He  had  been  working  in  the  South (probably Atlanta), and he told me of his experiences there and about bis near lynching in Gastonia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  happy  to  see  so  many  of my  old  comrades like Richard B.  Moore and Otto Huiswood. Then there was Cyril Briggs. I was anxious  to  make  his  acquaintance  as  1  had  been  in  the  Chicago post  of  his  African  Blood  Brotherhood  and  was  a  reader  of the <i class="calibre4">Crusader</i> magazine and his numerous articles in the  <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  also  Herbert  Newton  who  had  been  a  student  at K.UTVA and was now back in the thick of the struggle. He was the only  Black  member of the “Atlanta  Six,” a group of communist organizers  charged  under  Georgia’s  Insurrection  Act  and  facing possible electrocution. They had been arrested at an anti-lynching and  unemployed  demonstration  in  Atlanta.  (The  other  five defendants were Henry Story,  Ann  Burlack, Mary Dalton,  M.H. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p354"></a><img src="index-354_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">346</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers  and  Joe  Carr.)  Newton  and  his  co-defendants  were released  on bail as a result  of protest all over the country and were now  part  of  the  Southern  delegation  to  the  conference.  Ben Careathers  of  Pittsburgh,  Hathaway,  Browder  and  Baker  were some of the Party leaders  present among the delegates.  But there were  many  new  faces  at  the conference—comrades  with whom I was  to  work  in  coming  years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  convention  was  called  by  the  ANLC  as  a  national conference against lynching.  In  1930 alone there were thirty-eight lynchings, thirty-six Blacks and two whites. The conference was to be  transformed  into  the  founding  convention  of the  League  of Struggle for  Negro  Rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  gathering  opened  with  a  small  but  enthusiastic  mass meeting.  Its  declared  purpose  as  stated  in  the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> (November  4,  1930)  was  “to  build  a  powerful  fighting  mass movement  and  a  militant  newspaper to  lead  the Negro masses  in struggle against oppression and for thei r demands for full political and  social  equality  and  the right  of self-determination for Negro majorities  in  the  South.”  In  the spirit  of working class solidarity which  characterized  the  entire  conference,  a  presidium  of Black and  Southern  white  workers  was  elected  at  this  session. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  business  session  opened  on  November  15  with forty-four  Black  and  thirty-four  white  delegates  in  attendance.  A rousing  welcome  was  given  the  sixteen-member  Southern  delegation which  was led by Mary Dalton—a young white comrade, a National Textile Workers Union organizer and one of the Atlanta Six. Otto Huiswood made the report on the economic and pol itical situation  and  Herbert  Newton  reported  on  organization.  The delegates continued to arrive and by November 17, they numbered a  hundred-twenty—seventy-three  Blacks and  forty-seven  whites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conference then adopted a name for the new organization— </p>
<p class="calibre1">the League of Struggle for Negro  Rights (LSNR).  Upon arrival 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  submitted  my  draft  of  the  manifesto  for  the  league  to  the Resolutions Committee where it was discussed and approved. The manifesto—a  popularization  of the Party  program  for full  Black liberation—was  now  dramatically  proclaimed  by  Mary  Dalton amid  the  continuous  applause  of the  delegates.  It  declared  that</p>

<p class="calibre1">WHITE  CHAUVINISM  UNDER  FIRE</p>
<p class="calibre1">347</p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.  Blacks  were  an  oppressed  nation  struggling  against  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">imperialism and called for unity of Black and white workers in the fight  against  the  common  oppressor.  It  called  for  complete political  equality,  an  end  to  oppression  and  lynching,  to  be obtained  through  self-determination  of the  Black  nation  in  the South, the confiscation of the land in favor of Black and white soil-tillers,  and  state unity  of the Black  majority area.  This  could  be achieved  fully only  through  socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  immediate  program  demanded  abolition  of all  forms  of discrimination,  disenfranchisement,  anti-marriage  laws  and  Jim Crow.  It  urged  the  establishment  of  a  united  trade  union movement  to  include  Black  workers  on  the  basis  of  complete equality as an essential  step  in  cementing real  fraternal solidarity between  Black  and  white  workers  on  the  basis  of  common interests.  It called  for “mass  violation of all Jim Crow laws,” and </p>
<p class="calibre1">“death to the lynchers,” the banning of the KICK and all extra-legal terrorist  organizations, the liquidation of debts and mortgages of the poor farmers.  It urged members to organize LSNR chapters in communities throughout the country and to build the  <i class="calibre4">Uberator</i> as the official  organ  for the  new  organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary’s  speech  was  met  with  rousing  cheers  and  a  standing ovation.  A  national council was elected of which 1 was a member; Ben  Amis  was chosen  national secretary.  The Communist Party, through  Earl  Browder,  pledged  support  in  mobilizing  white masses  for  the  Black  liberation  struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  meeting adjourned  late  on the night  of November  19.  We stood  around the hall talking until about two in the morning.  Ben Amis, Otto and  myself left the  hall with a Jewish couple who had put us up during the conference. They lived in a middle class white neighborhood  and  had  driven  us  to  and  from  the  conference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Driving home, the conference successfully completed, we w6re all on  top  of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conference had been especially stimulating for me as it was the first  1  had  attended  since  my  return  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We pulled up in an alley behind their home to put the car in their garage. Otto,  Ben and 1 walked the short distance to the street and waited  while  they  locked  up.  As  we  stood  talking  a  squad  car</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a><img src="index-356_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">348</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">cruised  by.  Its  occupants,  four  white  plainclothesmen,  were immediately suspicious of three Black guys coming out of an alley in  white  St.  Louis  in  the  middle  of the  night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  squad  car  stopped  and  the  four  of them  got  out.  One  of them  hailed  us, “What  are  you  niggers  doing  here?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re  waiting for our friends;  we’re delegates from a convention.  Our  friends  are  putting  away  their  car;  we’re  staying  with them,”  Ben  replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were under a big street light and I could see the cops’ faces as they stared hostilely at us. Fortunately at that moment our friends came up.  They sized  up the situation immediately and intervened for us.  They  explained  we  were  their friends—they even  showed the convention badges we all had. “We live just around the corner; they’re  staying  with us,”  they  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  cop  in  charge  seemed  satisfied  with  the  explanation  and turned  to  his  friends,  saying,  “Okay,  let’s  go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  little,  mean-eyed  cop  standing  next  to  Otto  seemed  disappointed  at  this  turn  of events, that  he  would  be  deprived  of the pleasure of shooting or beating up niggers.  I figured him as one of those  kind  that  carved  notches  on  his  gun  for the  Blacks he  had killed.  Looking at Otto he said, “This nigger here seems like a bad nigger to  me;  you’re  a  bad  nigger,  ain’tcha?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was standing right next to Otto and knowing his temper, I kept pulling on  his sleeve.  Otto  muttered  something like, “Oh,  not so bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, you are, you’re a bad nigger,” the cop responded, trying to bait him. But the head cop urged his partners to leave. Reluctantly they  all  turned  away  and  got  back  in their  car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The incident  had a sobering effect, cutting through the euphoria of the evening and bringing us back to solid ground. It would have been  ironic  for  us  to  be  the  first  victims  of the  police  brutality against  which  we  had  inveighed  at  the  congress! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  returned  to  New  York via  Chicago,  revisiting  my aunts  and sister.  My Father, now living with a niece in Elgin,  Illinois, came into  the  city  to  meet  me.  Age  had  caught  up  with  him  and his hair had grayed.  He was still working as a janitor. I was glad to see  him  but  1  felt  sad  too...we  had  so  little  in  common. </p>

<p class="calibre1">All he saw for Otto and  me was trouble.  He was still a Booker T. </p>

<p class="calibre1">HARLEM  AND  YOKINEN:</p>
<p class="calibre1">WHITE  CHAUVINISM  ON  TRIAL</p>
<p class="calibre1">Back  in  New  York  I  was  temporarily  assigned to the national office  of  the  TUUL  and  put  on  its  payroll.  The  position,  as  I remember,  was a nominal one and  most of my work was with the Negro Department of the Party’s New York District, of which I was soon  to  become  head.  My  salary  was  twenty-five dollars a  week which,  in  those days,  was  quite  adequate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The twenty-five dollars was theoretical, however, for often there was not enough money in the till to pay the national office staff. In such  cases,  we  would  divide  up  what  there  was  or  if there  was nothing, go  without. There was no such thing as payment of back wages; if you missed one pay day that was it. It was all fair enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No Party functionary went hungry in New York—one could run up a bill at the restaurant on Union Square where the management was friendly to the Party. We were also invited to eat with different comrades. Several of us functionaries stayed for awhile in the town apartment of a comrade who lived in Croton-on-Hudson. Wc were never  bothered  by the  problem  of rent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My associates in the district included Black comrades like Steve Kingston  and Tom Truesdale, as well as Peters, a Hungarian who was  organizational  secretary,  and  Alberto  Moreau,  who  was  in charge  of  agit-prop.  Jack  Stachel  was  then  in  charge  of  the national TUUL office. Foster, the chairman, was still in jail for his part in the unemployment demonstration of March 6,1930, as was Israel  Amter, the district  organizer of New York. Jack Johnstone and Alfred Wagenknecht, TUUL board members, were always on hand  in  the  office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  was  a  strange  city  to  me.  Before  my  recent  arrival from Moscow, I had been in the city only once. That was upon my return from France after the  First World War. New York’s Black</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">community,  Harlem,  was  different  from  what  1  had  known  on Chicago’s  Southside.  Blacks  in  New  York  worked  largely  in service jobs as domestics and janitors, hotel, hospital and laundry workers, as railroad porters and dining car waiters. Some worked in light industry like the needle trades, but there were few Blacks in basic industry as  in  Chicago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harlem’s ethnic composition included a large segment of West Indian immigrants. I found them to be the most militant section of the  Black  population.  Racism,  American-style,  was  a  sharp contrast  to the more subtle racism of the West Indies and the new immigrants  reacted strongly. They drew on the West Indies’ long tradition  of anti-imperialist  struggle,  and it  was no accident  that they  comprised  a  large  proportion  of  our  first  revolutionary cadres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  world’s  largest  Black community,  Harlem was recognized as  the  cultural  capital  of Black  America.  <i class="calibre4">It</i>  was  the  home of the Black renaissance.  Harlem was the stronghold of Black reformism and  bourgeois  nationalism—the NAACP and  the  Urban League had their national headquarters there. The Garvey movement was born  there and remnants  still  survived  all  around  Harlem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  had  always  felt  building  a  revolutionary  movement,  which meant  building  unity  among  Blacks  and  forging  alliances  with white  workers,  was  more  difficult  here  in  New  York  than in  an industrial  center such as Chicago.  But the crisis of the Depression had  been  sort  of  a  catalyst.  Unemployed  Councils  were  built, uniting Blacks and whites, even in New York. There were marches on city hall and movements against evictions and police brutality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Branches  of  the  LSNR  were  built  in  Harlem  and  Brooklyn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harlem  was  soon  to  become  a  powerful  center  of  the  Black liberation  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout the country the communist movement was growing among  Blacks.  Many  hundreds  were  recruited  directly  into  the Communist  Party  and  thousands  into  mass  organizations  influenced by the Party; Unemployed Councils, trade unions, etc. This tremendous  advance  was  accompanied,  however,  by  a  wave  of racist manifestations and tendencies in the Party and mass organizations. This clearly reflected the stepped-up racist offensive of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">employers,  aimed  directly  at  halting  the  growing  unity  and maintaining the  division  between  Blacks  and  whites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mass  entrance of Blacks into the revolutionary movement flushed  out  hitherto  hidden  areas  of  white  chauvinism.  For example,  there  was  the situation  in  the needle trades where over 8,000  Blacks  now  worked.  Some  officials  of that  union—among them Party members—failed to support the special demands of the growing  number  of Blacks  coming  into  the industry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  some  shops,  Black  workers  received  lower  wages  than whites  for  the  same  work.  The  shop  committees  in those  places resisted  pulling a strike on the issue of equal  pay for equal work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maude  White,  recently  returned  from  three  years’  study  in  the Soviet  Union,  was  assigned  head  of  the  Needle  Trades  Union department.  She was shocked  by this flagrant violation of TUUL </p>
<p class="calibre1">principles and  even more so by the complacency of union leaders, among  whom  were  a  number  of comrades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  white  supremacist  attitudes  in  their  crudest  form  had cropped  up  in  a  number  of the  language clubs and cooperatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These often resulted in outright discrimination against Blacks. The language  clubs  (ethnic organizations  of nationalities  in the U.S.) had formerly been part of the language federations affiliated to the Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the  late twenties  as  part  of its holshevization campaign, the Party had shifted to organizations based on the workplace and street  branches  and  had  cut  out  the language  branches entirely.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party  fractions  within  the  language  clubs  and  cooperatives remained,  however. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was an incident at the Lithuanian cooperative restaurant in Chicago where comrades had refused to serve Black delegates to an  unemployed  conference  meeting  in  the  hall  above.  This  was done  on  the  plea  that  “it  would  hurt  business”  if  Blacks  were served.  The  restaurant workers suggested other places to eat and gave the Black delegates money for food. There was also a scandal in  Gary where the  Russian cooperative restaurant refused to  hire Black  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But most recent was the incident in New York at the Finnish Hall in  Harlem itself. The Finnish Hall had been established in an area</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a><img src="index-360_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">352</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">originally  settled  by  Finns  in  East  Harlem  around  Fifth  Avenue and  126th  Street.  Now  this  neighborhood  was  becoming  predominantly  Black,  and  the  hall  was  being engulfed  by the  Black community.  The  hall  bad  a  pool  room  and  gymnasium,  and sponsored many cultural, sports and educational activities. One of its  major  attractions  was  the  famous  Finnish  baths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several Black workers attended a dance at the Finnish Workers Hall.  Instead  of  receiving the  welcome  they  expected,  they  were pushed  into  a corner and  barely  escaped  being ejected.  The  caretaker,  August  Yokinen,  was  a  communist.  When  faced  with  the question of why he had not come to the aid of his Black comrades, Yokinen said he agreed with those who wanted to expel the Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apart  from  these  flagrant  manifestations  of white supremacy, the white chauvinist resistance to work among Blacks took a more subtle and dangerous form. It was reflected in a tendency to regard the  LSNR  branches  as  a  substitute  for  the  Party  in  the  Held  of Afro-American  work.  The practice was widespread on the part of local  Party  organizations  to  refer all issues  concerning  Blacks to the  LSNR;  to  regard  it  as  a  sort  of clearinghouse  for this  work, therehy  absolving the  Party  from  responsibility  in  this  field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  list  of white  racist  manifestations  was  long  and growing; clearly a crisis in the Party's  mass  work was  building up.  Further advance  required  a  renewed  drive,  a  counter-offensive  on  the question.  The  Party’s very  existence as an effective revolutionary force  was  at  stake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Party’s Negro  Commission—comprising the leading comrades in the work—was first to feel the pressure.  Harlem was up in arms;  complaints  poured  in  from  the  districts.  It  was  clear  that something  had  to  be  done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a member of the  Party’s National Negro Commission, I felt much  of  this  first  hand,  as  did  the  other  members  of  the commission.  O ur  chairman  was  B.D.  Amis,  an  articulate  and aggressive  man  with  considerable  organizational  ability.  But  he was relatively new in the Party and perhaps a bit unsure of himself in  dealing  with  older,  veteran  revolutionaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  raised  the  question  for  the  Politburo  to  intervene  directly and pusb the districts to take a more aggressive stand against white</p>

<p class="calibre1">supremacy.  But  Amis  made  no  headway  with  the  Politburo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs,  Maude  White  and  1  then  drew up a  document  listing  the various incidents of white chauvinism; we demanded the Politburo lake  decisive  action.  We  presented  our  document  at  a  Politburo meeting in  January. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Present  at  the  meeting were  Earl  Browder,  B.  D.  Amis,  Rose Wortis, Clarence Hathaway (then editor of the  <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker)</i> and others.  Briggs and  I  spoke first.  Briggs was sore as hell—so angry I hat his usual stutter disappeared.  Maude spoke last, dealing with lhe  needle  trades  situation  and  resistance to  the  demands  of the Black  workers.  She  became  so  emotionally  upset  she  burst  into tears and asked  to be relieved  of her  responsibilities  in the needle trades  unless  she were  given  more  support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An awkward silence settled over the room at Maude’s outburst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  what  seemed  an  interminahle  time,  Browder  broke  the silence—though  I  can't  recall  what  he said.  Hathaway spoke up, calling  for  some  dramatic  action  to  help  resolve  the  crisis,  He proposed  a  public  trial  of  those  involved  in  the  incident  at  the Finnish  Hall.  His  proposal  was  seized  upon  immediately  as something  concrete.  A  committee  was  set  up  to  work  with  the district  in organizing such a trial,  including Hathaway, Amis and myself as  members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  renewed  campaign  throughout  the  Party  against  white chauvinism  and  for  unity  of  Black  and  white  workers  got underway as a result of this meeting. A campaign of enlightenment resulted  which  was  tied  to  organizational  and  disciplinaiy  measures  against  those  guilty  of racist  acts.  A  number of expulsions look place.  Resolutions were adopted in all districts summarizing the  results  of the campaign.  For example the February  19,  1931, <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i>  carried  a  resolution  of  the  New  York  District Bureau,  “Close  Ranks  Against  Chauvinist  Influences.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  numher  of  hard-hitting  articles  were  also  published  in  the Party press, including that of the language groups. This was all tied to the mobilization for the Yokinen trial scheduled for March 1; it was also made part of the National Day of Action of Unemployed on  February  25,  when  marches  on state capitals were scheduled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our committee for the trial  held a meeting with the communist</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">fraction of the Finnish Club with  Yokincn  present. The members were  self-critical  and  agreed  that  they  had  acted  wrongly  in  not throwing out the racist elements at the dance. But Yokinen not only justified  his  position, he  even  carried  it further and argued that if Blacks were  allowed to enter the  club and pool room, they would soon be coming into the bath. And he for one did not want to bathe with  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Yokinen  trial  took  place  on  Sunday  afternoon  March  1, 1931,  in  the  New  Harlem  Casino  at  116th  Street  and  Lenox Avenue,  the  very  heart  of  Harlem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  morning 1  attended  a  meeting  of the steering committee responsible to the New York District for the conduct  of the trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tight  organization  was  required  because  the  entire  trial  was  to take  place  in  less  than  four  hours that  afternoon.  The  trial  had received wide  publicity in  both  the bourgeois  press and the Black press.  Our plans called for Wagenknecht, national TUUL organizer and  unemployed  leader,  to  be  chairman  and judge.  Clarence Hathaway  would  try  the  case  for  the  Party,  Attorney  for  the defense would  be  Richard  B.  Moore,  head of the Negro  Department  of the  ILD. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  arrived  at  the New  Harlem  Casino  early.  It  was  a  large  hall where dances were usually held, but it was already crowded. Over two  thousand  people jammed  the  hall,  most  went without scats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds  of Blacks, including women with babies  in  their arms, were  among  them.  Party  workers  moved  up and down  the aisles selling  magazines  and  buttons.  Banners  around  the  room  read, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Race Inferiority  Is  a  White  Ruling Class Lie!  Smash Jim  Crow Laws  and  Practices!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfred  Wagenknecht,  a  white-haired  veteran  revolutionary, called  the  court  to  order.  Selection  of  a jury  of fourteen,  seven whites and seven Blacks, was then begun. Nominations were made and  I  was  one  of the jurors  elected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hathaway, the prosecutor, stepped forward to present the case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was  a  forceful  speaker,  emphasizing  his  points  with his right hand  which  had  several  fingers  missing,  a  legacy  from  his  old machinist  trade.  In  a  lengthy  address,  often  interrupted  by applause,  he  described  Yokinen’s  crime,  outlined  the  communist</p>

<p class="calibre1">WHITE  CHAUVINISM  UNDER  FIRE</p>
<p class="calibre1">355</p>
<p class="calibre1">position  on  the  Afro-American  question,  and  demanded  Yokinen’s  expulsion  for  the  crime  of white  chauvinism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Comrade  Yokinen,”  declared  Hathaway,  “not  only justified lhe hostility shown to the Negro workers who attended the dance, but he went even further.  He claimed that if they were admitted to the club,  they  might go further and enter the pool room and even the  bath  house, and that  he did not wish to bathe in the same tub used  by  Negroes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Comrade Yokincn made  formal  acceptance of the communist principle  of  equal  rights,  but  he  was  not  willing  to  accept  its substance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The view Comrade Yokinen showed* Hathaway pointed out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“is  the  same  view  persistently  put  forth  among  the  workers  by capitalists. Everywhere, in church, in the press and in schools, you sec this conscious effort to cultivate race prejudice. The capitalists know that if they can develop feeling against the Negro among the white  workers  they  can  oppress  and  exploit  the  Negroes  and weaken  the  unity  of  Negro  and  white  workers.  The  theories expressed  by  Comrade  Yokinen  play  into  the  hands  of  the capitalist class and make him actually an agent of the bourgeoisie,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hathaway  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  Communist  Party,”  he  emphasized,  “is  committed  to abolishing all customs  which  prevent Negroes from enjoying full equality  with whites  in  every  way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  whole  courtroom  was  attentive  to  Hathaway’s  presentation; their attention now turned to Richard Moore who spoke for the defense.  The fine  Black  orator admitted the guilt of his  client and  that  he  had  committed  “a  grievous  crime.”  Moore  further contended  that  Yokinen  was  not  the  only  guilty  person.  He  had realized  the seriousness of his  offense  and now wanted  to correct his  errors  in  practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  is  the  vicious  bourgeois  system,  the  damnable  capitalist system which preaches corruption and discrimination which is the real  criminal,”  Moore  shouted.  “Middle  class  opportunism  permeated the  mind of Yokinen and caused him to object to Negroes using the club for fear white people would stay away and the club would  suffer economically.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a><img src="index-378_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">356</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moore continued, “Let us not yell for the blood of Yokinen, but examine  ourselves  and  see  how  far  we  have  contributed to  this thing of which  Yokinen  was  guilty. We  must  not  make a paschal lamb  of  Yokinen.  We  must  win  him  back.  Expulsion  from  the Communist  Party  is  worse  than  death  at  the  hands  of  the bourgeoisie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  audience  broke  into  loud  cheers  when  Moore,  with  his hands clasped  over his head, shouted, “I would rather my head be severed  by the lynchers than to  be expelled from the Communist International!  We must  not  destroy Comrade  Yokinen,”  pleaded Moore,  “Wc  must  save  him  for  the  communist  movement,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moore’s  plea  was  greeted  by  prolonged  applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yokinen  submitted  a  full  confession,  reading it  in  Finnish.  He admitted  to  having  been  influenced  by  white  chauvinism,  the ideology  of imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">„  MI refute and condemn my previous attitude...! want to prove in action  that  I  no  more  have  the  slightest  white  chauvinistic tendencies.  I  ask  this  workers’  court  not  to  deprive  me  of the opportunity  to  further  carry  on  my  activity  for the  Communist Party  and for  the  working class.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  jury  then  retired  to  return  half  an  hour  later  with  the verdict,  Thomas  Mitchell,  the  Black  foreman,  announced  the verdict. Yokinen was guilty. He should be forthwith expelled from the Party,  but might be readmitted after he had expiated his crime </p>
<p class="calibre1">• and  proved  his  worthiness  by  the  performance  of  a  number  of tasks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These were as follows:  1) To go immediately to the Finnish Hall, call a  mass  meeting and  give a report of the trial, couched in such </p>
<p class="calibre1">. terms as to destroy white chauvinistic tendencies in the club; 2) To carry  on  in  the  club  a  persistent  struggle  for  the  admittance  of Black workers and the granting to them of full privileges, including use  of the  poolroom,  bathhouse  and  restaurant;  3)  To  join  the LSNR and  sell an  adequate  number of copies of the  <i class="calibre4">Liberator</i>; 4) To  lead  a  demonstration  against  a  certain  Harlem  restaurant which  barred  Blacks;  and  5)  To  take  a  leading  part  in  all  the movements and activities aimed at doing away with discrimination of any  sort  against  Blacks. </p>

<p class="calibre1">WHITE CHAUVINISM  UNDER  FIRE</p>
<p class="calibre1">357</p>
<p class="calibre1">After  it  had  all  been  explained  to  Yokinen  in  Finnish,  he solemnly nodded his head and said, “I will do it, I did wrong at the dub.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The trial  ended with the audience singing the “Internationale,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">clenched  fists  held  high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  watched  the crowd swarm from the hall it  dawned on  me that  1  had witnessed  and  participated  in  a  historic  event  in  the buttle  for  Black  rights.  The  impact  of the  trial  was  tremendous throughout the country.  The most important  newspapers carried full stories and photos of the proceedings.3 The trial represented a breakthrough  in understanding the importance of the struggle of the Afro-American  people.  It was the first time the revolutionary movement  clearly  and  openly  declared  war  on  this  pillar  of American  imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for Yokinen, he conscientiously carried out his pledge made to the workers’ court.  He became a familiar and popular figure on the streets  of  Harlem,  in demonstrations  of the unemployed, for the Scottsboro  boys and against the Jim Crow  policies of a  local cafeteria.  After six months, he was readmitted to the Party as one of the  staunchest  fighters  for our  program. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  activities  of Yokinen,  including  his  attitude  at the  trial, evoked  the  wrath  of the  racist  government  and  its  Immigration Department,  and finally resulted in his deportation.  Although in the  country  thirteen  years,  Yokinen  had  never  taken  out  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship  and  faced  deportation  proceedings  on  charges  of belonging to  the Communist Party.  We were all surprised to hear (hat  he  was  arrested  by immigration  inspectors  the  day  after his trial. The International  Labor Defense carried on a campaign on his  behalf  which  failed  to  prevent  his  deportation several </p>
<p class="calibre1">months  later.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Yokinen trial was a significant turning point in the Party’s work  and came as the culmination of a long period of ideological struggle over the line of the Sixth Congress. I always felt that it had u  cleansing effect  on  the Party—heightened  the consciousness  of ( he cadre and cleared the deck, so to  speak,  of the most blatantly chauvinist  practices  within  the  Party.  The  trial  was  a  living political  demonstration  of  our  program  on  the  Afro-American</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">question  and  had  tremendous  repercussions  on the  Black  liberation front as a whole—for the first time, the Communist Party was seen  by  the  broad  masses  of  Blacks  as  a  serious  contender  for hegemony  of the  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the basis was  laid  for our revolutionary leadership in the great  battles  of  the  thirties.  It  was  directly  as  a  result  of  the campaign  around the Yokinen trial that the Party was ableto take up  the  case  of  the  Scottsboro  Boys  and  build  it  into  a  great international  movement.  Hundreds  of thousands  of people  were mobilized  in a militant struggle against one of the cornerstones of capitalist  oppression  of Blacks—the institution  of lynching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SCOTTSBORO</p>
<p class="calibre1">,  I  followed the Scottsboro issue closely from  the beginning. On March  25,  1931,  a  freight  train  crowded  with  young  people hoboing from Chattanooga to Memphis in search of work, passed through Paint Rock, Alabama. Nine Black youths were pulled off by the local sheriff and his deputies, charged with raping two white girls  who  happened  to  be  riding the same freight train.  The nine were:  Charles  Weems,  age  twenty;  Clarence  Norris,  nineteen; Haywood  Patterson,  seventeen;  Ozie  Powell,  fourteen;  Eugene Williams,  thirteen;  Olen  Montgomery,  seventeen;  Andy  Wright, eighteen;  Willie  Roberson,  fifteen;  and  Roy  Wright,  thirteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  situation  was  made  to  order  for  the  local  henchmen  of Alabama’s ruling oligarchy. The economic crisis had struck deeply into  the  entire  region  of northern  Alabama,  an  area  of  mainly small, family-size farms and a few textile mills.  Many in its largely white  population  were  facing evictions  and  repossession of tools and  livestock  by  the  banks.  In  the  textile  mills,  lay-offs  were throwing  many  out  of work.  But the sizable Black population  in the area  suffered  even  greater  hardships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moving  with  lightning  speed,  the  local  authorities  of  Paint Rock  lost  no time in exploiting the case. The boys were taken to Scottsboro (the county scat), where they were arraigned, indicted, tried and found guilty of rape in a period of less than three weeks. </p>

<p class="calibre1">WHITE CHAUVINISM  UNDER  FIRE</p>
<p class="calibre1">359</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  trial  began  on  April  sixth  and  ended  on  the  tenth,  with  the sentencing of eight boys to death in the electric chair. The case of the  ninth  victim,  Roy  Wright,  was  declared  a  mistrial.  The prosecution  had  requested  life imprisonment in view of his youth (he  was  thirteen),  but  the jury  returned  deadlocked  with  seven jurors  insisting  on  the  death  penalty.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">The trial was carried through in a lynch atmosphere. On the day it opened, mobs of white natives from the surrounding count ryside and  towns  surged  around  the  courthouse.  A  band  was  playing </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’ll Be A  Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight/’ The National Guard  had  been  called  out,  ostensibly  to  preserve  order  and prevent  the  mob  from  attacking  the  boys,  One  of  the  youths, however,  was  bayonetted  by  a  guardsman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  new  style,  legal  lynching  carried  through  with  the cooperation  of the  courts  and  law  enforcement  agencies.  It  was intended  to  guarantee  to  the  mob  the  same  results  as  would  be obtained  in  an  old-fashioned  burning  and  hanging  in  a  public square—the  death  of the  victims. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The courtroom farce at Scottsboro was a part of a wave of racist terror  sweeping  the  South  which  had  resulted  in  ten  known lynchings  in  the  past  three  months.  Clearly  its  purpose  was  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">“keep the nigger in his place,” to prevent unity of Blacks and poor whites;  in  other  words,  to  divert  the  unrest  of  Black  and  white workers  into  channels  of interracial  strife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This aim received open and brutal expression by the governor of Texas, Ross Sterling, an arrogant spokesman of the racist rulers of the South, Speaking of a case in his state, he stated, “It may be that this boy is innocent.  But it is sometimes necessary to burn down a house  in  order  to  save a  village.”6</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Chattanooga  Negro  Ministers’  Alliance  retained  Stephen R.  Roddy,  reportedly a  member of the Ku  Klux Klan, as defense attorney.  His  defense  amounted  to  little  more  than  pleading  for life  imprisonment instead of the death penalty. The NAACP kept a  low  profile  on  the  case  as  they  were  not  sure  the  boys  were innocent  and  they  wanted  to  avoid  the  possibility  of the  association  being identified  with  mass  rapists.  This  was  their official justification  for  holding  back  from  the case. </p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The  N.A.A.C.P.  is  not  an  organization  to  defend  Black</i> <i class="calibre4">criminals.  We are not in the field to condone rape, murder and</i> <i class="calibre4">theft  because it  is  done  by Black</i>  men...When  we hear  that eight colored men have raped two white girls in Alabama, we arc not first in the field to defend them. If they are guilty and have a fair trial  the case is  none of our business.7</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only when  confronted with the dispatch  of the 1LD and the  communists  in  taking  up  the  case,  and  with  the  widespread outcry  against  the  legal  lynching  in  all  sections  of  the  Black population, that the NAACP belatedly tried to enter the case and force the communists  out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  communists viewed the case in much  broader,  class terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  we  assumed  the  boys  were  innocent—victims  of a  typical racist  frame-up.  Second,  it  was  a  lynchers’ court—no one,  innocent  or  guilty,  could  have  a  fair  trial  in  such  a  situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">-  From the beginning we called for mass protest against the social crime  being acted  out  by Wall  Street’s  Bourbon henchmen in the South. On April 2, the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> called for protests to free the Boys.  Again  on  April 4,  the   <i class="calibre4">Southern  Worker</i> carried  an  article that  characterized  the case as  a  crude frame-up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  remember distinctly  how I  became involved in the case.  I  was sitting in  the  Party’s  district  office on Twelfth Street.  I  had  been reading the newspapers which were filled with stories of the trial in Scottsboro.  It  seemed  things  were  going  badly  there.  The  first group  of boys had  already been sentenced  to death  in the electric chair.  I  was  trying  to  figure  out what our next step should  be.  It was clear that if we did not take over the defense of at least some of the  boys,  they  were  doomed.  Suddenly  Sol  Harper  burst  in  on me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If there was one person who, before anyone else, understood the significance of the Scottsboro case and what the role of the Party should  be,  it  was  Sol.  Sol  Harper  was  a  tall,  rangy,  stoopshouldered  Black  comrade  about  thirty-five  at  the  time,  with prematurely graying hair.  He combined the qualities of a dedicated communist  with  the skills of an expert  investigative reporter.  He seemed  to  have  an  inexhaustible  store  of  information  about current  issues  and  knew  everything  that  was  happening  or  was</p>

<p class="calibre1">WHITE CHAUVINISM  UNDER  FIRE</p>
<p class="calibre1">361</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  to  happen  on  the  Black  rights  front.  He  always  carried  a brief  case  stuffed  with  clippings  from  current  newspapers  and magazines. When I first arrived in New York it was Sol who guided me through  Harlem, explaining what was happening on the streets and  introducing me to countless people.  One always felt  that  Sol had  his finger on the pulse of the people.  He knew what they were thinking  and  how  they  would  respond  to  any  event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  had  never  seen  him  so  agitated  as  he  was  that  morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the Party  going to  do?” he demanded.  The NAACP was selling these boys out, they were going to the chair, and the Black community  was  up  in  arms.  “We  have  to  step  in  now,”  Sol declared, “We must take over the legal defense.  Send our lawyers down  and  get  them  to  line  up  the  boys  and  their  parents.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sol got through to me that it was time for a decision. As soon as he  left  I  went up to the  national  office  on  the  ninth  floor  of the building to talk with  Amis and  enlisted  his support.  Together we went  to  see  Bob  Minor  in  the  next  office.  Bob  had  just  been released from prison after serving one year for his leadership in the March 6 Union Square demonstration against unemployment and for  relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob  was  keenly  sensitive  on  the  Afro-American  question  and saw “the great  mass  of Negro  people”  as  one of the greatest and most  effecive forces  for the revolutionary  overturn in  the United States.  He  had just finished reading the accounts of the trial and had arrived at the same conclusion  we had: the Party had to move in  on  the legal  defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three  of us went to speak  with  Browder.  He too had been reading  about  the trial  and  had just  received  a  first  hand  report from  Scottsboro  where  the  legal  lynching  was  taking  place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder agreed  that we  must  act  quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We immediately called a meeting with the ILD and thedecision to enter the case was made, the ILD moved with dispatch. Joseph Brodsky,  chief  lawyer  for  the  organization,  and  his  associate, Irving  Schwab,  went  immediately  to  Birmingham  and  Chattanooga where they got the consent of the parents and boys to enter the defense. Allen Taub.  another ILD attorney who was already in Chattanooga,  engaged  the  services of a  local  lawyer,  George W. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Chamlee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ILD had now gained control of the case. On April 10,1933, the  day  of  the  sentencing,  the  Central  Committee  issued  a statement in the   <i class="calibre4">Daily Worker</i> exposing thfc case as a “court house lynching” being carried out by the “Southern white ruling class.” It called  upon “all working class and Negro organizations to adopt strong resolutions of protest and  to wire these to the Governor of Alabama.” But wires to such capitalist officials alone, it went on to say, “will do no good; you must organize such at greatest possible speed  mass  meetings  and  militant  mass  demonstrations  against this  crime,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The statement concluded with the call to build a united front of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“all working people and farming masses of this country” and put forward the slogans, “Death penalty for lynchers!” and “Stop the legal  lynching  at  Scottsboro!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">^  On  May 23, Bob Minor, Amis and 1 left New York to attend the Xll-Southem  Scottsboro  Defense Conference which was to meet on  May  24  in  Chattanooga.  Minor represented  the  Communist Party, Amis spoke as Secretary of the LSNR, and I represented the TUUL. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon arrival  in Chattanooga,  we met with local comrades and Tom  Johnson,  the  Party’s  Southern  organizer.  The  four  of  us formed  a  steering  committee  for  the  conference  and  set  up  a command post in the home of a local Black comrade. Tom gave us the run down on preparations and expectations for the conference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  atmosphere  was  tense.  Local  newspapers  had  sought  to whip  up  hostility  against  the  meeting,  screaming  with  protests against  the  new  carpetbag  invasion  from the  north.  The chief of police  assured  the  white  community that  his  forces  were  alerted and  would  take  action  against  any  attempt  to  disrupt  the  racist status  quo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom was not even sure that the conference would be allowed to meet. We learned that police harassment had prevented the arrival of the  Alabama  delegation;  most  of them  had  been picked up  by Birmingham  police  as  they  were  getting  into  assembled  cars  to drive to the conference. Since it was early morning, before sunrise, they were charged with a violation of the Birmingham curfew laws. </p>

<p class="calibre1">363</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were later  released  without  fines,  but too late to attend  the conference.  I was disappointed fori had expected my brother Otto would  be  part  of the  Alabama  delegation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  fear that the police might try to disrupt  the conference by arresting  its  leaders  was  well  grounded.  We  adopted  security measures to prevent this. All of us on the steering committee took turns going to the conference hall one person at a time. When one returned  another would  go.  We adhered to this plan throughout the  conference  so  that  the  whole  steering  committee  wasnever present  in  the  hall  at  any  one  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was at this conference that I met Angelo Herndon for the first time.  Herndon was to become the victim of a frame-up in Atlanta just  a year later.  I  remember the enthusiasm and militancy of the two  hundred  delegates,  especially  of  the  local  people.  Other delegates told me that when Amis spoke he brought people to their feet as  he called on  Blacks everywhere  to  fight for the lives of the nine Scottsboro Boys. In this spirit, he invoked the memory of Nat Turner,  Frederick  Douglass  and  other  heroes  in  the  days  of slavery,  Bob  Minor,  as  1  understand,  also  gave  an  impressive speech.  I  too  spoke,  delivering  greetings  and  support  from  the TUUL. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  conference  ended  without  incident.  We  were  all  enthusiastic—it was the first conference against lynching to be held in the South.  Bob,  Ben,  Tom  and  I  were  exhilarated  and  dropped  our security  precautions  prematurely.  We  walked  down  to  the  conference  hall  and  stood  talking on  the  sidewalk, less than a block away  from  the  conference.  As  we  stood  watching  the  delegates leave we congratulated each other on the success of the conference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  patrol  wagon  swooped  down  upon  us and  the four of us were arrested and charged with “blocking the sidewalk.” Wc spent  the night  in jail and next morning Chamlce, our Scottsboro attorney, got  us  out  with a ten dollar fine each. </p>
