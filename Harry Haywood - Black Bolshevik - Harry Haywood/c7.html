<p class="calibre1">Chapter  7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The  Lenin  School</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  my  summer  in  the  Crimea,  I  returned  to  Moscow in  the  fall  of  1927  to  attend  the  Lenin  School.  The  school  was located off the Arbot on what is now called Ambassadors1 Row, a few  blocks  down  the  inner  ring  of boulevards  from  the  K.UTVA dormitories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Lenin School, which was set up by the Comintern, opened in Moscow in May  1926. The plans for the school, formally called the International Lenin Course, had been reported on the previous year  by  Bda  Kun,  then  head  of  the  Educational  (Agitprop) Department  of  the  Comintern.  Accordingly,  the  school  was  to train  sixty  to  seventy  qualified  students  both  in  theoretical  and practical  subjects,  which  included  observations  of  Soviet  trade unions and collective farm work.  It offered a full three year course and  a  short  course  of one  year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tt  was  a  school  of  great  prestige  and  influence  within  the international  communist  movement.  Its  students,  mainly  party functionaries  of  district  and  section  level  and  some  secondary national leaders who could be spared for the period of study, were generally  at  a  higher  level  of  political  development  than  the students  at  KUTVA.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  the  first  Black  to  be  assigned  to  the  school.  Others followed later; including H. V.  Phillips in 1928, Leonard Patterson in  the  thirties,  and  Nzula—a  Zulu  intellectual  and  national secretary  of the  South  African  Communist  Party. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  LENIN  SCHOOL</p>
<p class="calibre1">199</p>
<p class="calibre1">The American students who entered the Lenin School in the fall of  1927  were  an  impressive  lot.  They  included  prominent  Party leaders  from  the  national  and  district  level.  Outstanding  in  the group was Charles Krumbcin, a member of the Central Committee of the Party and formerly in charge of trade union work in Chicago and  district  organizer for  Chicago.  A  steamfitter by  trade  and  a charter member of the Party, he was one of a group of young trade unionists  who  made  up  the  Chicago  Party  leadership  in  the twenties. They were the best representatives of the radical tradition of that  city’s  labor movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modesty  and  honesty  were  hallmarks  of Charlie’s  character, and  he  was  a  man  of  exceptional  organizational  and  administrative  ability.  He  was  a  founder  of the Trade  Union  Education League (TUEL) and played a key role in the Chicago Federation of Labor.  We developed a close and lasting friendship, and I learned a  lot  from  him  about  Party  history  and  the  background  of the revolutionary  movement  in  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Margaret  Cowl, Charlie’s wife, was a capable  Party leader and organizer.  She  had  worked  in  the  TUEL  and  was  recognized particularly  for  her  leadership  in  the  struggle  for  unity  of Pennsylvania’s  anthracite  coal  miners  in  1927.  Later she was  to head up the Party’s Women’s Commission  and play an active role in  the  movement  for  a  Woman’s  Charter,  a  broad  united  front movement launched in  1936 which asserted the rights of women to full equality in all spheres of activity.  Margaret also energetically mobilized support for the struggles of women wage workers in the needle trades,  textile,  electrical  and  other industries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joseph  Zack  had  emigrated  to  the  U.S.  from  Eastern  Europe shortly after  the  First  World  War.  Active in the first communist organization  in  New  York,  he  had  been  section  organizer  of Yorktown  and  served  on  the  Party’s  Trade  Union  Commission.  Zack  was  one  of  Foster’s  leading  trade  union  cadres  in New  York  and  had  also  been  one  of  the  first  New  York  Party members  assigned  to  work  among  Blacks.  He  was  a  bitter enemy  of Lovestonc,  but  was  also  critical  of Foster.  In  1932,  he was  expelled  from  the  Party  for  refusing  to  abide  by  democratic centralism and  by the forties  had become an informant for</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Dies  Committee  on  Un-American  Propaganda  Activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris  Childs*  a  Chicagoan,  was  a  leader  in  trade  union  and Party work.  He  became  Illinois  D.O.  in  the thirties  at the same time  that  I  was  chairman  of  the  Cook  County  Committee  and secretary  of the  Southside region.  While at the Lenin School,  he served as the representative of the American students to the School Bureau. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rudy  Baker,  a  Yugoslav  comrade  who  later  became  D.O.  in Pittsburgh and in Detroit, and Lena Davis (Sherer), a good friend of  mine  who  was  organizational  secretary  for  New  York  in  the thirties,  were  also  at  the  school.  All  of  these  students  were members  of  the  Foster  group.  As  far  as  I  can  recall,  the  sole Lovestone  supporter  in  our  class  was  Gus  Sklar  of  Chicago,  a leader  in  the  Russian  Federation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor Gus was alone in the midst of Fosterites, and it must have been  an  unhappy  experience  for  him.  When  Lovestone  was expelled from the Party in 1929, Gus remained in the Soviet Union and never returned to the  U.S.  He served as an  officer in the Red Army and was killed in the defense of Moscow during the Second World  War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The American students at the Lenin School were all experienced leaders of the U.S.  Party.  One might ask why so many were spared from  U.S.  work  at  a  time  when  the  Party’s  position  among the masses  was  so  weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually,  these  students  were  victims  of Lovestone’s  purge  of the  Party  apparatus  following  his  victory  at  the  Fifth  Party Convention  in  1927.  Part  of Lovestone’s strategy was to  weaken his opposition on the home front by “exiling” some of its leaders to the  Lenin  School. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His plan  backfired however.  In Moscow, these “exiles,” as they jokingly  called  themselves,  were  to  become  an  effective  lobby against  Lovestone  both  in  the Comintern and in  the CPSU.  The political  winds were  changing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the ashes of the defeated Trotskyist “left ” rose an equally dangerous,  organized  and  secret  rightist  opposition  headed  by none  other  than  Lovestone’s  patron  in  the  Comintern,  Nikolai Bukharin.  On the home front, this rightist opposition had its social</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE LENIN  SCHOOL</p>
<p class="calibre1">201</p>
<p class="calibre1">base  among  the  capitalists,  the  landlords  and  the  kulaks  (upper peasantry) and pushed a line that would have lopsidedly developed industry along consumer lines, to the detriment of the vast masses of  Soviet  people.  Internationally,  Bukharin  greatly  underestimated the war danger and the potentially revolutionary situation then  developing  on  a  world  scale.  At  the  same  time,  he greatly overestimated  the  strength  and  resiliency  of imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Lenin  School  students  helped  to  legitimize  the  anti-Lovestone struggle in the U.S.  Party by linking it up with the fight against  the  right  deviation,  then  only  in  its  incipient  stage.  The Lenin School was to become a strong point in the fight against this danger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  several  other  American  students  who  had  entered the Lenin  School  the year  before.  This  group  included  Clarence Hathaway,  Tom  Bell,  Max  Salz.man  and  Carl  Reeves (the son  of Mother Bloor).2 Of this group,  Hathaway had the most imposing credentials.  A machinist from Minneapolis and one of the leading people  in  the Trade Union  Education  League,  Hathaway proved to  be a  valuable  asset  in  the  Party’s  trade  union  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  a  fine  organizer  and  speaker,  particularly  effective in debates,  and  combined  these  talents  with  a  good  grasp  of Marxist-Leninist theory.  Clearly destined for top leadership in the Party,  he  later  served  as  D.O.  of  the  New  York  District, became  an  editor  of  the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i>  and  a  member  of  the Political Bureau.  Tom  Bell,  Hathaway’s close friend, remained in the  Soviet  Union,  married a Russian  woman  and  died sometime before World War II. </p>
<p class="calibre1">William  Kruse of Chicago  was the principal Lovestonite in the school.  For a  brief period  he filled in as acting rep from the Party to  the Comintern  in  the absence of a permanent Party rep.  Later, he  was  D.O.  in  Chicago  under  Lovestone’s  leadership  and  was expelled  from  the  Party  with  Lovestone  in  1929. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The students were organized at the school by language groups, as  we  had  been  at  KUTVA.  In  this  case,  the  languages  were English,  German,  French,  Spanish,  Italian,  Russian  and,  later, Chinese.  The whole school  was a collective,  comprising students, teachers, administrators and employees. The leading body was the</p>

<p class="calibre1">202</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Party  Bureau,  which  included delegates from the various groups, including  the  employees.  All  students  transferred  membership from their home party to the CPSU, and were directly subject to its discipline.  Party  meetings  were  held  about  once  a  month. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  rector  was  a  handsome,  energetic  woman  named  Kursanova.  She was a leading communist educator and was married to the old  Bolshevik propagandist and CC member, E.  Yaroslavsky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  about  forty  at  the  time  and  had  an  impressive  background,  including civil  war experiences as a machine-gunner in a detachment  of  Siberian  partisans.  Kursanova  had  also  been  a delegate to the Bolshevik Conference in April  1917 which adopted Lenin’s  famous  April  Theses.3</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition  to  the  Americans,  others  in  the  English-speaking section  included  British, Irish, Australians, a New Zealander, two Chinese,  two  Japanese  and  two  Canadians —Leslie  Morris  and Stewart  Smith.  The  British  group  included  Springhall,  Tanner, Black  (a  Welshman),  Margaret  Pollitt  and  George  Brown.  My special  friend  among the  British  was  Springhall,  known to all as </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Springy,”  with  whom  I  roomed  at the  Lenin  School. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Springy was a British naval veteran of the First World War. He had come from a poor family and his parents had chosen him for a naval  career.  This  latter  act,  it  seemed,  was  a  common  practice among British lower class families with several sons. At the age of twelve, therefore, he had been “given” to His Majesty’s Navy to be trained  as  a  sailor,  He  served  through  the  First  World  War and after  the  Armistice  was  involved  in  a  mutiny  or  near-mutiny among members of the fleet who protested being sent to Leningrad to  intervene  against  the  Bolshevik  Revolution.  At  the  time, Springy was about twenty-one years old. As a result of the mutiny, he was  cashiered  from the  Navy.  Apparently,  the  admiralty  was deterred from taking any harsher measures against the mutineers because  of  the  widespread  sympathy  their  action  had  evoked among  British  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Springy  was  popular  with  everybody,  particularly  among  the women  on  the technical staff.  After leaving the Lenin School,  he returned to England where he rose rapidly in Party leadership. He also  fought  in  Spain  as  a  member  of the Fifteenth  International</p>

<p class="calibre1">Brigade  and  was  wounded  at  Jarama. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the beginning of World  War II, he served as organizational secretary of the British  Party.  During the early stages of the war, Springy was charged by the Churchill government with subversive activity among the armed forces. This was during the period prior to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, when the war was still an  imperialist  war  and  we  communists  opposed  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  no  defense  against  the  charge  of  subversion  in wartime  England,  and  Springy  was  sentenced  to  seven  years  in prison.  After his  release,  he went to China, where he did editorial work on English language publications until his death from cancer in  1953.  Springy  died  in  a  Moscow  hospital,  where  he  had  been sent by his Chinese comrades to make sure that everything possible could  be done to save him.  His ashes were returned to China and interred  with  a  memorial  stone  in  the  Revolutionary  Martyrs’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cemetery  outside  Peking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Springy  introduced  me  to  the  gifted  English  writer,  historian and Marxist scholar, Ralph Fox. A promising young theoretician, Fox  was  then  researching  material  for  one  of  his  books  at  the Marx-Engels  Institute.  He died at the age of thirty-seven, fighting the  fascists  on  the Cordova Front during the Spanish  Civil  War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  end  of  his  brief  life  span,  he  had  already  published  a tremendous  body  of work.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got a lot out of my friendship with Fox. Profiting greatly from his wide-ranging knowledge, I often  consulted him on theoretical and  political questions which arose during my stay at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Springy  and  I  were  frequent  visitors  at  the apartment  of Fox and  his  wife  Midge.  It  was  there  that  I  first  met  Karl  Radek.  A Polish expatriate, he had  been an active leader in the Polish Social Democratic  Party  and  a  member of the Zimmerwald  Left (those internationalists  who broke off from the Second  International  in 1915 and were instrumental in founding the Third International). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1915-16,  Radek—along  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rosa  Luxemburg—publicly </p>
<p class="calibre1">disagreed  with  Lenin  on  the  question  of  self-determination  of subject nations.5 Radek later changed his position and fully united with  the  Bolshevik  point  of view  in  1917. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Radek was part  of the group that returned with Lenin to Russia</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a><img src="index-212_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">204</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">via Germany  in  the famous “sealed  coach.”6  He was a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee and Politburo. At the time that I met  him  in  1928,  Radek  was still under a shadow politically.  He had  been  a  leading  member  of the Trotsky-Zinoviev  opposition and was expelled from  the CPSU along with the other leaders of the bloc at the Sixteenth Congress of the CPS U in December 1927. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Exiled to the Urals,  he publicly repudiated his earlier position and was  readmitted  to  the  Party  a  few  months  later in  1928.  He was assigned  as  editor  of  <i class="calibre4">Izvesfia</i> and  later  became  the  chief foreign affairs  commentator  in  the  leading Soviet  papers.  He  was  also a member  of the  Soviet  delegation  to  the  Comintern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Radek,  as  I  remember  him,  was  a  little  man,  appearing to  be somewhat  of a dandy in  his  English tweed jacket,  plus-fours and cane.  But to me, the most striking thing about him was his beard. It stretched  from ear to  ear,  under his chin and cheeks, giving him a simian  look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His English, though accented, was fluent. When we first met, he immediately  engaged  me  in  a  conversation  about  conditions  of Blacks in the United  States,  which branched off into questions of Black  literature,  writers  and  the  Harlem  Renaissance.  To  my amazement, it was clear that he knew more about the latter subject than  1  did.  1  was  embarrassed  when  he asked  my  opinion  about certain  Black  writers with whom  he was familiar but whom I had never even  read.  I  found  out later that Claude McKay had  been a sort  of a  prot£g£  of Radek’s  during the  poet’s  stay  in  the  Soviet Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1937,  along  with  several  others  in  the  Trotskyite  “Left Opposition,”  Radek  was  convicted  of  treason,  of  acting  as  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">“agency” of German and  Italian fascism  and  giving assistance to those  who  might invade the Soviet  Union.  He was sent  to  prison where  he  died  in  the  forties.7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Springy  introduced  me  to  many  other  young  Britons  in Moscow:  such  men  as  William  Rust, who  later  became editor  of the  <i class="calibre4">British  Worker</i>;  Walter Tapscll,  editor of the   <i class="calibre4">Young  Worker;</i> and George Brown.  Both Brown and Tapsell were in my brigade in the Spanish  Civil  War and  were killed in battle.  Brown was  killed at  Brunete  while  1  was  there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a><img src="index-213_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE LENIN  SCHOOL</p>
<p class="calibre1">205</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our English-speaking section at the Lenin School included five young  Irishmen,  all  members  of  the  Irish  Workers  League,  a communist-oriented group organized by Big Jim Larkin in  1923. It seems that the Irish Communist Party, founded in  1921  by Young Roderick Connolly (son of James Connolly), had collapsed.81 was told  that  its  failure  was  due to  a lack  of Marxist-Leninist theory and the inability of its members to relate their views on socialism to the specific conditions in Ireland.  But there was certainly no lack of  revolutionary  enthusiasm  and  motivation  among  the  young people  1  met  at  the  Lenin  School,  some  of  whom  had  been members of the Irish Communist Party. The group had been sent to  the  Lenin  School as  a step towards  rebuilding the Irish  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All five were prot£g£s of the famous Irish revolutionary, Big Jim Larkin—most  definitely a man  of action and organization,  not of theory.  A tall,  bulky man  with a huge,  hawk-like nose and bushy eyebrows,  Larkin was  one of the most colorful figures of the Irish labor movement.  From  his  base among Dublin dockworkers, his activities as a labor leader had ranged over three continents... from the British  Isles, to Argentina,  to the U.S.— and at the time that 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">met  him,  spanned  more  than  three  decades.  He  had  been  a founding member of the U .S. Party  and was a member of both the Executive  Committees  of the  Communist  International  and  the Red International of Labor Unions (RILU or the Profintem).  He was  often  in  Moscow,  where  I  saw  him  frequently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Irish students came from the background of the 1916 Easter Rebellion and the revolutionary movement reflected in the lives of men  like  Larkin  and  James  Connolly.  Among  them  were  Sean Murray  and  James  Larkin,  Jr.  (Big Jim’s  son).9 All of them had been  active  in  the  post-war  independence  and  labor  struggles.  I was  closest  to  Murray,  the  oldest  of  the  group,  who  was  a roommate  of mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was my first encounter with Irish revolutionaries and their experiences excited me. As members of oppressed  nations, we had a  lot  in  common.  I  was  impressed  by  their  idealism  and  revolutionary ardor and their implacable hatred  of Britain’s imperialist rulers, as well as for their own traitors. But what impressed me most about  them  was  their  sense  of  national  pride—not  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a><img src="index-214_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">206</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">chauvinistic  variety,  but  that  of  revolutionaries  aware  of  the international  importance  of their independence  struggle  and  the role  of Irish  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  too,  they  were  a  much  older nation.  Their fight  against Britain  had  at  that  time  been  going  on for  750 years.  They were fond  of quoting the observations of Marx and Engels on the Irish movement,  such  as  Marx’s  letter  to  Engels  in  which  he  said: </p>
<p class="calibre1">“English reaction  in  England  had  its  roots  in  the  subjugation of Ireland.”10  Another  favorite  was:  “No  nation  can  be  free  if  it oppresses  other  nations.” 11</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  most  of all,  they  liked  to  point  out  Lenin’s defense of the Easter  Uprising  in  his  reply  to  Karl  Radek,  who  had  called  the rebellion  a putsch and  discounted the significance of the struggle of small  nations  in  the  epoch  of imperialism.  Lenin  admonished Radek,  stating that “a struggle capable of going to the lengths of insurrection  and  street  fighting,  of  breaking  down  the  iron discipline  of  the  army  and  martial  law,”  on  the  doorstep  of the imperialist  metropolis  itself, would  be a blow against imperialism more  significant  than  that  in  a  remote colony.12</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  shortly  to  find  these  observations  applicable  to  the liberation movement of U.S.  Blacks.  Asa result of my association with  the  Irish,  I  became  deeply  interested  in  the  Irish  question, seeing in it a number of parallels to U.S. Blacks. In retrospect, I am certain that this interest heightened my receptivity to the idea of a Black  nation  in  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">TEACHERS  AND  CLASSES</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  teaching  method  at  the  school  was  a  combination  of lectures and  discussions.  About  once a week the instructor would give a lecture to the entire English-speaking group, all twenty-five or  thirty  of us.  Readings  would  be  assigned,  and  when material was  not available in English, it would  be translated especially for us.  I had one advantage in this regard  because by this time I could read  Russian fluently.  Following the lecture, the instructor would delineate a  number of sub-topics.  Several days later, we would all</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  LENIN  SCHOOL</p>
<p class="calibre1">207</p>
<p class="calibre1">get together again and  one  person from each group would report on  its work.  The instructors were often available for consultation during the time the  groups were discussing and  researching their topics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were no grades given,  nor were there any examinations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the end  of the term wc  would  have evaluation sessions, where everyone  met  and  discussed  each other’s  work,  including that  of the  teachers.  It  was  a  process  of  comradely  criticism  and  self-criticism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I found the classes exciting and challenging  and the students on the whole sharp and on a high political level.  I was under pressure to  keep  up.  The  English  in  general  seemed  to  be  a  notch  above most  of  us  in  political  economy.  This,  I  believe,  was  due  to  the existence  of a  large number of Labour Party schools which were spread  throughout  Britain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our instructor for  Marxist political economy was Alexandrov, an  economist  for  the Gosplan,  the  state  planning agency.  In  our class,  he  was  often  challenged  on  some  aspect  of  Marxian economics.  He would  often  have sharp exchanges with one of the British  students,  I  believe  it  was  Black,  over  differences  in interpretations  of Marxian  economics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  was  a  perfect  foil for Alexandrov, who seemed  to enjoy these tilts and  invited  the whole class to participate.  Summing up the  discussion,  Alexandrov  would  brand  Black’s  position  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">“undialectical,  mechanistic, and  rooted  in  vulgar economism and Fabianism.”  Black  was  stubborn,  however,  and  prodded  by Alexandrov, kept up his critical attitude for the whole first term. It was  only during the evaluations at  the end  of the term that Black conceded  that  some  of his  positions  had  been  in  error. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps the most prominent among my teachers was Ladislaus Rudas, a noted  Hungarian Marxist philosopher and scholar. Like many Hungarian intellectuals, he spoke several languages fluently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had been a leader of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet and had come  to  Moscow  along  with  Bela  Kun and  the other Hungarian refugees.

<p class="calibre1">We  had  lengthy  discussions  on  the  French  Revolution;  the petty  bourgeois dictatorship under Robespierre and the Jacobins; Saint  Just and  the  extreme left,  the  Thermidor and  Napoleon— </p>
<p class="calibre1">“the  man  on  the  white  horse.”  The  English  Revolution  and Cromwell,  the  Levellers,  the  Long  Parliament.  The  Dutch  revolution  and  Prince  Egmont.  We  had  extended  discussions  on  the American  revolutions...the War  of  Independence,  the Civil War and  Reconstruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  discussions  brought  out  our  lack  of  knowledge  of our own U.S. history; there was a complete absence of materials which presented  U.S.  history  from  a  Marxist  standpoint.  All  I  can remember is the so-called Marxist analysis in the works of James Oneal   <i class="calibre4">(The  Workers  in  American  History)</i>  and  A.M.  Simons’s <i class="calibre4">Social Forces  in  American  History. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The former  I  never read,  but the work by Simons stands out in my memory for its gratuitous slur on U.S. Blacks, Simons claimed that the Black man  did not  revolt  against slavery during the Civil War: “His inaction in time of crisis,  his failure to play any part in the struggle that  broke his shackles, told the world that he was not of those who to  free  themselves  would  strike  a  blow.”13</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  had  read  about the slave revolts of Gabriel,  Nat  Turner, and John  Brown’s  heroic  raid  on  Harper’s  Ferry  with  his  band  of whites, free  Blacks and escaped slaves. I knew of the role of Black soldiers  in the Civil War who  had to overcome the opposition  of the Union  Army in  order to fight. Simons’s book skipped over all of this, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  had  come  across  Charles  and  Mary  Beard’s   <i class="calibre4">The  Rise  o f</i> <i class="calibre4">American  Civilization. </i>  The  Beards  were  economic  determinists who  had  characterized  the  Civil  War  as  the  Second  American Revolution.

He called  our  attention  to  the  writings  of  Marx  and  Engels,  their correspondence on the Civil  War,  and  Marx’s series of articles in the  <i class="calibre4">New  York Herald Tribune</i>. 14 After the discussions, I submitted a paper to the class, which evoked considerable discussion. On the whole  it  was  well-received  by  my  fellow  classmates  and  commended  by  Rudas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  our  most  interesting  and  stimulating  course  was  on Leninism and the history of the CPSU,  taught  by the  historian L </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mintz.  A former Red Army officer, he was at the time assigned to work on a history of the CPSU. Mintz was a young Ukrainian Jew, a  soft-spoken  and  mild-mannered  little  man.  He  had  a  way  of illustrating  his  subject  through  his  own  personal  experiences during  the  Revolution  and  the  Civil  War  in  the  Ukraine.  His appearance  contrasted  sharply  with  his  role  and  bloody  experiences  in  the  battle  for  the  Ukraine.  His  was  a  thrilling  story, involving a meteoric rise from leader of partisans to commander of a  Red  Army  brigade.  They  had  fought  against  a  whole  array  of anti-Soviet  and  interventionist  forces:  the  White  Guardist  Deni-ken;  the  Cossack  Hepmans,  Kornilov  and  Kaledin;  Makhno’s anarchists  (who  were sometimes  with  and sometimes against the Red  Army); General  Petlura and sundry gangs of marauders and pogromists;  and  the  remnants  of  the  German  garrisons  in  the Ukraine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In connection  with our studies of the Bolshevik agrarian policy during  the  Civil  War,  Mintz  told  us  of his  involvement  in  the settling  of  the  question  of  land  redistribution  in  a  Ukrainian district.  This  district  had  been reconquered by his Red Army unit from  Denikin  in  the  early  winter  of  1920.  He gave  us  a  general rundown  of the  agrarian  situation  at  the time,  the class  forces in the countryside,  their shifting alignment  during the course of the Revolution,  and  the  evolution  of Bolshevik  agrarian  policy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kerensky’s  provisional  government  had done nothing to solve the agrarian  problem,  to relieve the land  hunger of the masses  of peasantry.  Though  Kerensky’s  program  had  promised  confiscation of the big estates, once in power, the government reneged on</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  that  level  of reform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Bolsheviks  exhorted  the  peasants to await  the decision of the Constituent Assembly. Thus, at the time of the outbreak of the Revolution,  the  vast  majority  of the  cultivatablc  land  was  still concentrated  in  the  estates  of the  big  landlords.  The  peasantry, constituting  four-fifths  of  the  population  of  the  old  Czarist Empire,  was  composed  of three  different  strata.  The  well-to-do peasant  not  only owned  enough land to  support himself in good fashion,  but  also  often  hired  labor to  work  his  land.  This group comprised  only  about  four to  five  percent  of the totaL  The poor peasant  was  without  sufficient  land  to  support  himself and  his family  and often  hired  himself out as a laborer to the landlord or to  a  well-to-do  peasant.  The  landless  peasant  subsisted  entirely from  the sale  of his  labor to  the  landlord  or  well-to-do  peasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  the  slogan  “Land,  Bread  and  Peace,1'  the  Bolsheviks combined the seizure of power in the cities with the land revolution underway  in  the  countryside.  Allied  with the Social  Revolutionaries  (SRs),  the  traditional  party of the  peasantry,  the  land was taken  over  in  two  phases.  The  first  phase,  nationalization  and confiscation, was incorporated in the Land Decree of the All Russian Congress of Soviets, November8,1917. This stamped the seal of governmental endorsement on the land seizures and called for their extension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  September  1917,  Lenin  declared  Bolshevik  support  for  the land  program  of  the  SRs,  while  pointing  out  that  only  a proletarian revolution could put even this program into practice.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  SR  program called for equal distribution of land among the peasants  while  the  Bolsheviks  favored  collective,  and  eventually state-owned  farms.  But  since  the  SR  program  represented  the understanding  of the  majority  of peasants,  Lenin's  policy was to resolve  this  difference  by  “teaching  the  masses,  and  in  turn <i class="calibre4">learning  from  (he  masses, </i>  the  practical  expedient  measures  for bringing about  such  a  transition.11,6</p>
<p class="calibre1">The day after seizing power, the Bolsheviks put this policy into practice with their November 8,1917, Decree on Land which made the  SR  program  into  law.17  Within  three  weeks,  the  SRs1  left wing—representing the poorer  peasants—had  split  from the rest</p>

<p class="calibre1">of  the  party  and  entered  a  coalition  government  with  the Bolsheviks.  In the following years, Lenin held to the basic position he stated  when  presenting the November  8  decree: As a democratic government, wc cannot ignore the decision of the masses of the people, even though we may disagree with it.  In  the fire of experience,  applying the decree in practice, and carrying it out locally, the peasants will themselves realize where  the truth  lies... We  must  be guided  by experience;  we must  allow complete freedom to the creative faculties of the masses.1 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  against  this  background  that  Mintz related some of his experiences  in  the  Ukraine.  He  told  us  that  the  Party  in  the Ukraine  had  not  fully  grasped  the  lessons  of  the  agrarian revolution  in  Great  Russia.  He  spoke of one  occasion  when  his outfit had attempted to arbitrarily carry out the collectivization of all the big estates in territory occupied by their division of the Red Army;  their  efforts  met  with  the  stiff  resistance  of  the  local peasants,  even though  the  peasants  supported  Soviet  power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  peasants  insisted  on  the  redistribution  of all  the  estates, breaking  them  up  among the  individual  peasant  families,  rather than  taking  over  the  large  estates  collectively.  This  occurred during the fall months of 1919, on t he eve of Denikin’s final defeat, when  Soviet  power  in  the  form  of an  “independent  Ukrainian Republic”  was  about  to  be  established. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a time when Lenin, in order to allay anti-Russian distrust and  suspicion  among the  Ukrainian  peasantry,  had insisted that certain concessions be made.  Both Russian and Ukrainian were to be  used  on  an  equal  footing,  and  attempts  to  push  back  the Ukrainian  language to a secondary status were to  be denounced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lenin  demanded  that  all  officials  in  the new republic  be able to speak  Ukrainian  and  called  for  the  distribution  of  large  farms among  the  peasants.  State  farms  were  to  be  created  win  strictly limited numbers and of limited size and in each case in conformity with  the  instruments  of the surrounding  peasantry.” 19</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  this,  M int/  said,  many  of  us  Ukrainian  Bolsheviks</p>

<p class="calibre1">tended  to  downplay  the  nationality element  in  our own country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In my own case, I had long since ceased to consider myself a Jew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of  them  were  what  was  called  at  that  time  “abstract internationalists”;  super-internationalists  who,  in  the  name  of internationalism, renounced the national element in the struggle of the  Ukrainian  masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  we  were  not  alone  in  this  deviation,”  Mintz  told  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Although  Lenin’s  policy  was  eventually adopted  by the Central Executive Committee, it was sharply opposed by leading Ukrainian  Bolsheviks such as Rakovsky  and  Manuilsky.  What  it  finally came down to, in the case of our army division, was that as a result of the opposition of the peasants in the area, wc were forced to give up  our plan  for collectivization;  we thus  had to settle for having only  one  of the  estates  being set  aside  as  a  Soviet  farm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first part of each summer at the Lenin School was spent in poetical  work  that  related  to  our  studies.  In  the  course  of  my practical work program in the early summer of 1928,1 had my first close-up observation of the peasant question in the USSR. I visited a peasant  village  in an agricultural district  to talk with the people and  make  observations.  Though  hardly  more  than  100   <i class="calibre4">versts</i> (about 66 miles) from Moscow, it was truly in “darkest Russia,” a provincial  place, isolated from the city.  Few inhabitants had been as  far  away  as  Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After taking a train to the nearest  station,  I  then  had to take a <i class="calibre4">droshky</i> another twenty  <i class="calibre4">versts</i> to the county seat.  Arriving in the morning,  I  was  let  down  in  the  middle  of the  village  square.  I looked  around to get  my  bearings,  and  in  no time at all, a crowd had  gathered  to  stare  at  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowd  grew larger hy the minute;  it seemed as if the whole village  had  turned  out  in  the  square.  I  could  overhear  remarks: </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who  is  he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why  is  he  so  Black?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  nice teeth!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,  his  palms  are  white!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He seems   <i class="calibre4">s y m p a tic h n o </i> remarked  some. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone else who  perhaps  had  done a  little reading said, “Oh, he’s probably from Africa. There the sun is so hot that people who</p>

<p class="calibre1">have lived there for thousands of years become black.” The crowd seemed  to  accept  this  explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  stuck  out  my  hand  to  a  young  man  standing  nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Z d r a v s iv u y te </i> I  said.  "Could  you  direct  me  to  the  town committee?”  He  seemed  to  be  surprised  that  1  could  speak Russian, but getting himself together, he directed me to a building across  the square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who  are  you?  Where  did  you  come  from?”  the  young  man asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘T m  an  American  Negro  from  the  United  States,”  I  replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone  in  the  crowd  remarked,  "1  told  you  he  was  of the Negro tribe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone  else  spoke  up,  "I  thought  all  people  in  the  United States  were  white.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  gave  me  the  chance  to  get  off  on  my  international propaganda spiel, and I jumped right in. "Oh no,” I replied. “There are  twelve  million  Blacks  in  the  U.S.—ahout  one-tenth  of the population” I went on to tell them about  Blacks in the South, and the  modern-day  remnants  of  the  plantation  system:  sharecropping,  Jim  Crow  and  lynch terror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone  remarked,  "Oh.  Like  it  was  with  us  under  the  old regime.”  Many  of the villagers  nodded  their heads  in  agreement with  this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then I noticed an old woman with a cane, slowly making her way  through  the  crowd  toward  where  I  was.  The  young  people gave way before her, in deference to her age. When she reached the center,  I  watched  the changes  in  expression  on  her  old  wrinkled face as  she gazed  at  me.  First  it  registered  amazement  at  such  a sight;  then  comprehension  when  she  had  “cased”  the  whole situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  she  spit  on  the  ground  and  slammed  her  cane  down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“fdite  domoi! </i>  Go  home!”  she  told  me.  “Wash  your  face!  You should  be  ashamed  of yourself,  trying to fool the people around here!”  Waving  her  cane  at  me,  she  then  turned  scornfully away.  In  all  her  ninety-odd  years,  she  had  never  before  seen a  Black  man! </p>

<p class="calibre1">TENTH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE </p>
<p class="calibre1">BOLSHEVIK  REVOLUTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first time I  met Stalin was at a social gathering,  a party in the  Kremlin  during  the  World  Congress  of  the  Friends  of the Soviet Union. The congress coincided with the Tenth Anniversary celebrations  in the fall of 1927. The congress sessions were held at the  <i class="calibre4">Dom Soyusov</i> (House of the Trade Unions). It was the greatest international gathering I had ever witnessed. There were probably more than one thousand delegates, representing countries from six continents.  The  most  impressive  delegation  was  the  huge  one (about  one  hundred  people)  from  China  which  was  headed  by Soong Ch’ing-ling, the young and beautiful widow of Sun Yat-sen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Today she is vice-chairman of the National People’s Congress of the  People’s  Republic  of China.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">f was surprised  and delighted  to  meet my old  friend Chi (Dum Ping), a former Chinese student at the University of Chicago with whom  I had worked  in the organization of the ill-fated Interracial Youth Forum on the Southside in 1924. He had since gone back to China  and  was  now  one  of  the  translators  for  the  Chinese delegation.  It  was  Chi  who  introduced  me to  Madame Sun Yat-sen.  She spoke  English  with an  American accent,  which  was not surprising since  she  had  been  educated  in  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  the  other  notables  we  were  to  meet  were  the  young Cuban  revolutionary,  Antonio  Mella,  later  murdered  in  Mexico City  by  Machado’s  assassins.  He  was  a  tall,  wiry  youth,  who always  had  a  guitar  slung  over  his  back.  There  was  Henri Barbussc, a pale, wan man, a victim of tuberculosis. He was a great literary  figure  in  France  and  wrote a  biography  of Stalin.  There was  the American novelist Theodore Dreiser, father of American realism, who was there with his secretary, Ruth Epperson Kennell, a  young  American  woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  special  friend  of us  Black  students  was Josiah Gumede,  the elderly president of the  African National Congress  and  a descendant  of Zulu  chiefs.20 We took him in charge.  Every  morning we would call for him at his room at the National Hotel on Tverskaya</p>

<p class="calibre1">(now  Gorky  Street)  and  escort  him  to  the congress sessions.  Wc also accompanied him on the rounds of parties held by the various delegations.  He  must  have  been  about sixty  at the time,  but was big,  strong and  healthy  and  never seemed  to tire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  gala  occasion  for  the  whole congress  was  the  Evening of National  Culture.  It  consisted  of  an  elaborate  pageant  of  folk dances from the various Soviet republics and autonomous regions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dancers were all in their traditional costumes, a striking array of color and diversity. On this occasion, our Soviet hosts went all out for  their foreign  guests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hall  in  the   <i class="calibre4">Dom  Soyusov</i> had  been converted  into  a huge banquet room.  Wc were seated  before tables loaded with various kinds of liquor, including of course, the best vodka and zakuskas; appetizers  of all  kinds —cheeses,  herrings,  caviar,  cold  sturgeon and  cold  meats.  Then  came  dinner,  from  soup  to  dessert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  banquet  finally ended.  Most  of us  were in somewhat of a stupor  from  food  and  drink.  Our  group,  which  included  our teacher  Sik,  was  leaving  the  hall  amidst  the  din  of a  thousand people  talking  and  laughing.  On  our  way  out  we  stopped  and chatted  with  numerous  delegates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gumede was the chief attraction; he had given a stirring speech at a session of the congress a few days before. As I recall, we were nearing  the  door  when  we  were  stopped  and  greeted  by the  old Cossack cavalryman,  Marshall  Budenny.  He was a short, powerful,  bow-legged  man,  with  a  large  ferocious  black mustache.  He was  also  in  a  merry  mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell  the  chief/’  he  said,  grasping  Gumede's  hand,  “that  we stand  ready to  come to  his  support  anytime  he  needs  us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank  you,  thank you,”  beamed  Gumede. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, someone approached us, I believe it was Tival, Stalin’s secretary, and informed us that we were invited to a party in  the  Kremlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We walked  the short distance across the square to the Kremlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once within the Kremlin walls, we were guided into one of the old palaces and then taken upstairs to a small hall. It was a long room with an arched ceiling reaching almost to the floors on the sides. It looked to me as though it could have been a throne room of one of</p>

<p class="calibre1">216</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK.  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">the old  czars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were perhaps fifty people in the room.  In the center there was  a large tabic loaded with the traditional zakuskas, fruits and drinks.  It  was sort  of a buffet; chairs were not directly at the table but  rather were  along the  walls  on  each  side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  in  the  center  on  one side  was  Stalin,  with  a  number  of people seated  beside  him.  He rose, shook our hands, and after we were  introduced,  welcomed  us,  “Be our  guests.”  He  was  a short, thick-set  man,  as  I  remember,  dressed  in  a  neat  tan  suit  with  a military  collar  and  boots  shined  to glisten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  motioned  us  to  the  vacant  chairs  on  the  other side  of the room.  On that side were a number of folk dancers and musicians, presumably  participants  in  the  earlier  festivities.  Somebody introduced  Gumede  as  an  African  Zulu  chief from the congress, and the dancers probably thought we were all from the same tribe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gumede,  however, was the center of attention, surrounded by the dancers,  who  insisted  on  being photographed  with him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  gathered  around  him—a  couple  sitting  on  his  lap  and others  behind  him with their arms  around  him.  Stalin,  observing all this from the other side of the room, seemed amused.  Later on, Stalin  got  up,  bid  us  all  good-night  and  walked  out.  As  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">remember,  it  was  quite  a  relaxed  evening  with  no  political discussion.  We left shortly after Stalin departed  and were driven home  by  a  chauffeur  from  the  Kremlin  car  pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  version  of  this  occasion  was  given,  I  believe  by  Sik, who insisted that Otto had danced with Stalin that evening. 1 don’t doubt  Sik’s  word,  but  1  certainly don’t  remember seeing it.  Otto didn’t remember the incident either. But I do know that in Russia it was  not uncommon for one man to dance with another on festive occasions.  As  1  recall,  the  hall  became more crowded,  and  I  was attracted  by a group  of folk dancers who offered to help us students  with  our Russian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterwards  Sik  kept  reminding  Otto,  “Don’t  you  remember, Otto, you asked  Stalin  to dance,  and you danced  around the hall with  him  several  times.  That  was  a  memorable  occasion;  how could  you  forget  it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for Gumede, he returned home a firm supporter of the Soviet</p>

<p class="calibre1">Union.  Everywhere  he  went,  he gave glowing  reports  of his visit there.  In January  1928, he told an ANC rally that "I have seen the new world to come, where it has already begun.  1 have been to the new  Jerusalem.”21</p>
<p class="calibre1">One  day  in  December,  Otto  called  me  and  said  he  had  just gotten a call to pick up a young Black woman, Maude White, who was to be a student at KUTVA.  She was waiting at the station. He asked  me  if  l’d  like  to  go  along  and  I  readily  agreed,  looking forward  with  pleasure  to  meeting  this  woman—the  first  Black woman  since  Jane  Golden  to  study  in  the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We rented a  <i class="calibre4">droshky</i> and proceeded to the station.  It was a cold winter  night,  the  temperature  was  somewhere  around  thirty-five below zero.  When we got  there,  we saw the young Black woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  about  nineteen,  standing  in  the  unheated  station.  She was  a  strikingly  pretty,  brown-skinned  woman  with  huge  dark eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had on a seal skin coat, silk stockings and pumps, and by the time we got there she was practically hysterical with the cold. “Get me out of here. Get me out of here,” she shouted. Otto and 1 looked at each other, both thinking the same thing—we’re going to have a rough  time  with  this  one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We couldn’t  have been  more  wrong.  Maude got  right into the swing  of  things  at  school.  She  was  a  very  popular  student  and stayed  in  Moscow  for three years.
