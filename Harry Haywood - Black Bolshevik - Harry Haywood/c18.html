<p class="calibre1">Why  did  I  go to  Spain? </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  me,  as  a  communist,  Spain  was  the  next  logical  step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franco’s rebellion  in mid-1936  sparked a civil war which became a focal point of the worldwide struggle to halt fascism and prevent World War II. The generals’ rebellion against the Spanish people’s front  government  was  backed  by  Hitler  and  Mussolini,  who poured  in  troops,  tanks,  planes  and  supplies  in  an  attempt  to topple  the  progressive  Republican government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Spanish  Civil  War  was  a  part  of the  worldwide drive  for fascism.  Spain  had  become  the  next  item  on  their agenda,  after north  China and Ethiopia. The Soviet  Union called for collective action  to  stop the  aggression  in  Spain,  but the western capitalist</p>

<p class="calibre1">468</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracies  responded  with  a  so-called  non-intervention  pact which  allowed  Hitler and  Mussolini to  flood  men and  munitions into Spain while the U.S., France and Great Britain refused to sell war supplies  to  either  side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Betrayed  by  these  appeasement  policies,  the  Spanish  Loyalist forces faced seven to one odds in equipment and materials. Fascist atrocities  shocked  the  world  as the Nazis used Spain as a testing ground  for  new  weapons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  April  26,  1937,  the small  village of Guernica in the  Basque province  of Vizcaya was  hombed  by  German  planes from ahout four-thirty  in  the  afternoon  until  eight  at  night.  The  population was  strafed  by  machine  guns  as  they  fled  and  1,654  people were killed,  889  wounded.2  Communist  parties  throughout  the  world rallied  to  the  defense  of  Republican  Spain  and  organized  tbe International  Brigades,  made  up  of communists  and  other  antifascist  fighters,  to  answer the fascist  aggression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our Party in  the  U.S. took up the call. It came during a time of deep  domestic  crisis  and  increasing  radicalization  of masses  of Americans.  We were already involved in the fight against domestic fascism and were developing a popular front under the leadership of  communists.  There  was  widespread  support  for  Republican Spain.  Over 3,000 American volunteers traveled there, making up the  majority  of the  Lincoln  and  Washington  Battalions  of the Fifteenth  Brigade.  More  than  1,500  died  there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  another  step  in  the  fascist  plan  of  world  conquest,  Spain made  the  threat  of  fascism  at  home  more  immediate.  Although there  were relatively  few  Blacks—not  more  than  a hundred  who volunteered for Spain—there was generally support and sympathy for the Republican cause in the Black community.  Already alerted to  the  dangers  of  fascism  through  the  defense  of  the  Ethiopia campaign,  Blacks  played  an  active  role  in  the  movement  to support  Republican  Spain with the National Negro Congress and the Southern  Negro  Youth Congress adopting strong resolutions against  fascist  aggression  and  for collective  security.3</p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  Black  man,  I  was  acutely  aware  of the threat  of fascism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacks have always faced the most brutal, racist oppression in the United  States,  but  fascism  would  mean a great heightening of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  SPANISH  CIVIL  WAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">469</p>
<p class="calibre1">terror and oppression.  I felt it was wrong to say that the conditions of Blacks “could not be worse under fascism." It was through this understanding, that  1 felt the strongest solidarity with the Spanish people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  eager  to  go  to  Spain.  We  had  carried  on  an  active recruiting  campaign  for the  brigade.  Many  of  my  co-workers  in Chicago had volunteered—Oliver Law, Tom Trent, Oscar Hunter and  others.  Also I felt  it would afford me the opportunity to learn many lessons in revolutionary struggle which would be invaluahlc for our  Party and  my people.  Finally,  I  felt the presence of Black communists in Spain would help emphasize the solidarity between the  Afro-American  and  Spanish  people  in  the  struggle  against fascism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  reminded  of  this  later  on  in  Madrid  when  Boh  Minor introduced  me  to  La  Pasionaria  (Dolores  Ibarruri),  the  great woman communist  leader who  embodied  the whole sentiment  of the Spanish people's struggle.  She was happy to see me and related how impressed she had  been when she had  watched the parade of the  International  Brigades  through  Valencia  on  the  way  to  the Aragon  front.  Leading  them  was  a  handsome  Black  youth carrying the American flag.  “How remarkable that Black people, so  oppressed  themselves,  sec the relation of our struggles and  are here  to join  us."  she said.  “What  happened to that  young man?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  was  Milton  Herndon,  Angelo's  brother,"  I  replied. “He was  killed  a  few  days  later  on  the  Aragon  front." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite heroic efforts,  the  civil  war  in  Spain ended in a tragic defeat for the world's anti-fascist forces. The death of the Spanish Republic  emboldened  the  fascists  and  led,  six  months  later,  to Munich,  the  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia,  and  with  that,  the inevitable  outbreak  of the  Second  World  War in  which  millions died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the people's forces were defeated in Spain, their cause was not.  The fascists could claim this initial battle, but the courageous example set by the Spanish people and the International Brigades, even in defeat, inspired millions across the world to stand up to the fascist  tide.  In  the  end,  it  was  fascism  that  was  crushed  and  the people's  forces  that  triumphed.  Those who fell  in  Spain were the</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanguard  of the victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally, I also suffered a defeat, a setback which would affect my  life  in  the  Party  for  some  years  to  come.  My  experience  in Spain  was  shortlived,  lasting  only  about  six  months.  It,  and  its aftermath, which I relate in the following chapter, focus on some of the more negative features of the International Brigades. But they should not  be allowed to detract from the overall epic struggle that Spain represented.  I have not attempted to detail the political and military  history of the  brigades in Spain.  This has been done in a number  of  books.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Late in the winter of 1937 1 raised the question of going to Spain with  Browder,  and  he tried to dissuade me.  I would be the highest ranking  member  of the  li.S.  Communist  Party in Spain and the sole member of the Politburo. He had been receiving reports about the problems in the brigade and probably questioned my ability to handle the job.  I was persistent, however, and Browder brought it up  before  the  Politburo  where  it  was  reluctantly  agreed  upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  the next few  weeks,  the  Party took steps to strengthen  its leadership  in  Spain  and  sent  over several  top  organizers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We sailed  for Spain on the  <i class="calibre4">lie de France</i> out  of New York. Our large  group  of  volunteers  went  through  the  usual  charade  of pretending  not to know each other.. -just tourists meeting for the first  time.  The leadership group was composed  of Bill  Lawrence, Ed  Bender of New York  and  Dave  Mates  from Chicago—all  old Party  functionaries  whom  l  knew.  The  crossing was  uneventful, and  we  docked  at  Le  Havre,  taking  the  boat  train  to  Paris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  headquarters  of the  International  Brigades  on  Rue  de Lafayette we were taken in charge by the French Party. We spent a few  days  in  Paris,  and  I  went  to visit  my friends Otto  Huiswood and his wife, Hermie Dymont. Huiswood headed the International Trade  Union  Committee  of  Negro  Workers,  which  had  been  in Hamburg until  Hitler’s rise to power.  From Paris we went by train to  Perpignan  near  tbe Spanish frontier, where a  local committee took  charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were split up and lodged in a number of farmhouses outside the town.  I was impressed  by the strength of the anti-fascist forces in  which  the  local  communists  were  the moving  force.  We  were</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  SPANISH  CIVIL  WAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">471</p>
<p class="calibre1">treated with great courtesy and hospitality by our hosts. Lawrence, Bender,  Mates and  myself were  put  up  in the same house to wait lor  our turn  to cross  the  Pyrenees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While waiting I  had  a  bad  attack of asthma.  It  was the allergic type which  1  attributed to some ragweed in the vicinity; I had had such attacks before and I assumed this would go away once we got out  of the  area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One night at about  midnight we were roused and told to fall out with  our  baggage.  We  were  to  begin  our  march  and  cars  were waiting to drive us south towards the border, After about an hour’s drive, we pulled up near a river and got out. This apparently was an assembly  spot.  A  number  of  comrades  were  already  there  and others  were  arriving  by  car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  formed  a  column  of probably  a  hundred  men—including several guides and a doctor.  We marched towards the river where we  were  told  to  strip  and  wade  across:  As  I  remember  the  river wasn’t very  wide or deep, but  once we were in, we found the early spring  water  was  ice-cold  and  chest-high.  We  got  to  the  other bank, dried off, put on our clothes, reformed our ranks and began to climb. We were told to keep close, not to straggle, because of the French border guards. There were guides in front and file closers in the  rear  to keep us together so there’d be no stragglers. They set  a very  fast  gait, </p>
<p class="calibre1">We walked  quietly, climbing steadily for a couple of hours.  My asthma  was  bothering  me,  and  1  had  difficulty  breathing  and found it hard to keep up with the column. It got worse and I finally fell  to the ground, completely out of breath.  The column stopped, Two of the young men  who were our file closers rushed  forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  stuck  a  pistol in my side as  1  lay there, saying, “Get  up,  you bastard,  you  volunteered,  it’s  too  late  to  change  your  mind!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  knew  what  was  on  his  mind.  He  was  afraid  that  stragglers might  disclose  the  secret  trails  to  the  French  border  guards  who were  carrying  out  the  orders  of  Premier  Blum’s  non-interventionist  French  government  to  close  off the  borders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My comrades immediately interceded, asserting that they knew me, that I was an important anti-fascist leader, that I must really be ill and wasn’t  faking.  They called the doctor over and he checked</p>

<p class="calibre1">me over with his stethoscope.  He said, “Yes, this man can’t go any further,  to  do  so  might  cause  irreparable  damage  to  his  heart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What to do? The summit and the frontier were a couple of hours away.  One  of the guides,  an elderly  man,  pointed  to a hut  on the mountainside, a short distance from the trail.  He said it was vacant and  suggested  I  should  stay  there,  rest  up,  and  come over in the morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of my comrades said someone should stay with me; the old man  volunteered,  The  column  reformed  and  marched  away, leaving  me  with  the  old  man.  I  felt  ashamed  and  somewhat humiliated  at  not  being able to  make it over the mountains.  I  had been  in  fairly  good  health ever  since  I  had  left  the  Army;  but,  I thought  to  myself,  1  was  getting  old  (I  was  thirty-nine  and  no mountain  climber). </p>
<p class="calibre1">After resting  in  the  road for a few minutes,  I told  the old  man that I felt l could make it to the hut. He looked at me anxiously as if to  say, “Can you  really go?”  He insisted  on carrying my pack and helped me to  my feet.  Leaning on him, 1 made it to the hut. It was a one-room affair with a cot.  I flopped down really fagged.  He told me to  get some sleep, that he was going down the mountain to get some food  and  would  be back shortly.  1  gave him an incredulous look—you’re going down there where we came from? “Oh, that’s nothing.  I’ve  climbed  mountains  all  my  life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After he left I fell fast asleep and woke when the sun was bright in  my  eyes.  There  was  the  old  man  sitting  beside  me,  waiting patiently  for  me  to  wake  up,  He  smiled—and  produced  some cheese  and  wine  which  1  ravenously  attacked.  He  asked  if 1  was ready  to attempt the climb, that it  was only  a short distance, and we  would  go  slowly,  resting whenever I was tired.  He carried  my pack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  reached  the summit after a series of short hikes and pauses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  we met the guards  of the Loyalist  Spanish  Republic.  They greeted  us; the old  man  knew them.  They said  our comrades had passed  through  several  hours  before.  They  insisted  we  have breakfast with them. The old man remained. The guards told me to follow  the  road  to the  Figueras,  an  ancient  fortress  now  used  as barracks  for  brigade  volunteers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p495"></a><img src="index-495_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  SPANISH  CIVIL  WAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">473</p>
<p class="calibre1">A truck soon came by, and 1 hopped a ride into Eigucras. I met up  with  my  comrades  again,  as  they  had  been  detained  there  to wait  for  transportation.  Worried  about  my  health  and  the possibility  of not  being allowed  to  go to the front.  I  went to see a doctor.  After  a  thorough  examination,  he  assured  me  that  my health was alright and he saw no reason not to go to the front. The lour of us in the leadership group were driven to Barcelona where we  spent  the  day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  our  stay  in  Barcelona  we  spent  some  time  seeing the sights.  Walking  down  the  Rambias  de  Catalunia,  we  suddenly stopped  and  did  a  double-take.  It  was  Bert  Wolfe!  He  also stopped,  startled  at seeing us.  He had  been a leading member and chief  lieutenant  of the  Lovestone  group  and  had  been  expelled with  Lovestone from  the  Party  in  1929. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was he doing here in Spain, we wondered.  We recognized each  other—exchanged  startled  looks  and  then  turned  and  went our separate ways.  We were sure he was up to no good for he had turned  virulently  anti-communist.  Looking  back  on  it,  our suspicions may well have been justified.  For only a few weeks later, there  was  a  counter-revolutionary  putsch  of  the  POUM,  the Trotskyite organization.5 It  was reasonable to assume that Wolfe would  have  made  common  cause  in  their  struggle  against  the communists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  left  Barcelona  and  eventually  arrived  in  Albacete,  a provincial  capital,  now  the  headquarters  of  the  International Brigades.  There  were  five  International  Brigades:  the  eleventh, chiefly German, called theThaelmann Brigade; the twelfth, chiefly Italian,  known  as  the  Garibaldi  Brigade;  the  thirteenth,  mainly East  European;  the  fourteenth,  chiefly  French;  and  the fifteenth, composed  of  Americans,  French,  Belgians  and  Balkans.  The fifteenth,  due to the later predominance of Americans,  was often incorrectly  called  the 44Abraham  Lincoln  Brigade.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this time,  all the brigades were under the political command of  a  triumvirate  based  in  Alhacete:  Andr6  Marty,  leader  of the famous  French  Black  Sea  Mutiny  and  member  of the  Political Bureau  of  the  French  CP,  was  commander,  Luigi  44E!  Gallo” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longo,  second  in  command  of  the  Italian  Party,  was  inspector</p>

<p class="calibre1">general  (he  was  later  to  become  Togliatti's  successor  as  Party chief); and Giuseppi di Vittorio was chief political commissar. The General  Commissariat,  under  their  leadership,  was  the  multilingual  command  apparatus  in  which  all  nationalities  were represented.  Lawrence assumed the position as American political commissar  of the  Albacete  base,  Bender  became  his  assistant  in charge of cadre,  and  Dave Mates left Albacete for Tarazona de la Mancha  to  become  political  commissar  of  the  Washington Battalion  which  was  then  in  training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even before we left the States, we had heard of the terrible losses suffered hy the Americans of the Lincoln Battalion of the Fifteenth Brigade at Jarama. Upon our arrival in Albacete, George Brodsky, the acting American representative, filled us in on the details. The situation  was  much  worse  than  we  had  expected.  The  action  of February 27 on the Jarama front resulted in a needless slaughter of American  volunteers  and  their  fellow  battalion  members,  the Irish, Canadians and Cubans, Ill-equipped, largely untrained, and without  the  promised  artillery,  air  or  tank  support,  they  were thrown  against  an  impregnable  fascist  strongpoint,  Pingarron Heights,  in  their first  engagement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This attack was carried through on the insistence of General Gal and  Lt.  Colonel Vladimir Copic,  and over the protest  of Captain Merriman, the American  battalion commander,  Charging up the hill,  the  Lincolns  were  caught  in  a  murderous  machine  gun crossfire.  It  was  a  virtual  massacre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The results were that  our batallion which  had entered the lines with  450  men,  had  200  killed  or  wounded,  leaving  only  250 </p>
<p class="calibre1">effectives  on  the line.  The casualties included most of the officers, Douglas  Seacord,  second  in  command,  William  Henry,  commander of the first company, and adjutant Eamon McGrotty were all  killed  in  the attack,  Captain  Merriman was wounded,  as was my  old  friend  and  schoolmate,  the  Englishman  Springhall, Springy  was  an  assistant  to  brigade  commissar  and  along  with Merriman  had  led the assault.  My good  friend from Hyde Park, our  YCL  organizer Tom  Trent,  was  also  killed that  day, The responsibility for this crime lay with General Gal, division commander,  and  Copic,  the  brigade  commander.  Their  incom-</p>

<p class="calibre1">pclcnce was exposed  further when it was later learned that a little lul l her  down  the  line  there  were  ill-defended  enemy  positions where  a  breakthrough  could  have  been  made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I )espite the handicaps and bungling by the hrigade and division commands,  the  Lincolns  fought  with  great  heroism  and  determination.  The International  Brigades played an  important role in hulling  the  fascist  offensive  aimed  at  cutting  the  Madrid  to Vnlcncia  road,  the life artery of Republican  Spain,  and  thwarted I heir  efforts  to  encircle  the  capital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a few days in Alhaccte, I left for the front, accompanied by I  nwrence and Bender. Our front lines were situated along the crest of a hill which rose in a gentle slope from the Morato road,ahout a kilometer away.  About halfway up sat a small Spanish villa which wax  used  as  brigade  headquarters.  Entering the villa,  we met Lt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(  olonel  Copic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much to my surprise, 1 recognized him asuSanko,” an old Lenin School  student  from  the  Slav  language  group.  He  had  been one year ahead of me and so I had known him only slight ly.  He seemed genuinely  pleased  that  I  was the  brigade's  new  adjutant  political commissar and embraced  me warmly.  1  learned  that  he had  been mi officer in  the Austro-Hungarian  Army and had received some Red  Army  training.  He  spoke  English  fluently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  introduced  us  to  the  members  of the staff.  There was Col. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Huns  Klaus,  chief  of  staff,  a  former  Imperial  German  Army officer,  George  Aitkea  brigade  political  commissar,  my  direct superior and  a Scottish veteran of Paschendale—the World War 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">holocaust  of British  and  Canadian troops; Major Allan Johnson, on leave from the U.S. Army and the highest ranking Army officer in  Spain  (he  had  come  to  the  brigade  after  the  February  27th disaster); and  Lt.  George Wattis, former British officer and nowin charge  of  brigade staff mess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copic  took  me  aside  to  give  me  his  account  of  February  27. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to him, the attack on  Pingarron Heights was necessary und had to be carried out as General Gal had ordered. Of course it wax difficult for the American volunteers to understand.  After all, I hey  were  no  soldiers,  he  said,  but  only  raw  recruits  without tmining—pampered  by  easy  living in  the  States  and  unprepared</p>

<p class="calibre1">476</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the rigors of battle.  He reminded me that it takes time to make a soldier.  We  alt  took  a  drubbing  that  day,  the  Americans  were nothing special. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I listened, growing angry at his disparaging remarks. Of course all of this was true, but it still didn’t explain the suicidal assault on Pingarron.  These volunteers  were not the “do  or die” type.  They were  political  soldiers,  ideologically  committed  and  they  knew who  was  responsible,  Copic’s  account  amounted  to  a  dispar-agement  of the  American  effort  and  a  complete  denial  that  the command  was  in  error, </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  went  up  to  the  trenches  to  meet  the  men.  I  was  struck  by their  youth;  many  were  YCL’ers  and  I  recognized  only  a  few. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among those I knew was Oliver Law, a former Chicago comrade, head  of  the  Southside  1LD  and  one  of  the  several  American volunteers  with  military  training.  Law  was  a  veteran  of  the Twenty-fourth Infantry, a Black regiment, and was now commander  of  the  Lincoln  machine  gun  company.  He  had  been  an important  member of our Southside leadership.  I  remember him running  the  police  gauntlet  at  the  Forty-eighth  Street  precinct during the Ethiopia demonstration.  He  had  been  a victim  of Red Squad sadism during the unemployed struggles in the early thirties when  he  was  heaten  up  and  deliberately  kicked  in  the  groin.  It seemed  right and  logical that Oliver should be in the front lines in Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  happy  to  see  that  he  had  survived  the  February  27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">ordeal,  but  saddened  when  he  told  me  that  the  young  Irishman.  Tom  Trent,  was  among  those  who  had  perished  in  battle that day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  also  met  Martin  Hourihan,  battalion  commander,  a  former Regular  Army  calvary  man,  teacher,  seaman  and  trade  union leader. The fellows were happy to meet us and glad the 13.S. Party now had  some  leading  memhers  in  Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  hopes that we could be of some help, they poured forth their complaints.  They  were  heefs  concerning  poor  equipment,  food and  clothing.  They  suspected  some of these problems arose with the  Spanish  Premier  Largo  Caballero.  Rumor  had  it  that  the international brigades were heing discriminated against in terms of</p>

<p class="calibre1">477</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  limited  amount  of equipment  available  because Caballero,  a right wing socialist,  hated the communists,  But the men’s bitterest complaints  were  directed  at  the  brutal  incompetence  and  irresponsibility of Copic and Gal. The men had absolutely no faith in their leadership and were particularly angered by the fact that they had had no relief in four months. They wanted adequate American representation  on  the  brigade staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  then  spoke  with  Allan Johnson.  He was very impressive and struck  me  as  a  first-rate  officer,  a  graduate  of  the  U.S.  War College  who  had  been  a  Regular  Army  captain  assigned  to  the Massachusetts  National  Guard.  Though  he  arrived  at  the  front after the Jarama battle, he felt the men’s complaints were justified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  particularly  outraged  at  what  he  considered  to  be  the incompetence of the brigade and division leaders. He felt that they had  failed  to  exercise  common  sense.  His  opinion  was  that something had  to  be  done, at  least the removal of Copic, because the  colonel  had  lost  the  confidence  of  the  men  of the  Lincoln Battalion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lawrence,  Bender  and  I  talked  it  over  and  agreed  that something had to be done. The two of them returned to Albacete and  made  an  appointment  with  Marty’s  adjutant,  Vidal.  He was sympathetic and advised  us  to return  in two weeks. We returned, and  he  explained  that  it  was  impossible  to  remove  Copic.  Vidal assured  us  that  the  men  would  be  given  relief—new  weapons, clothing and equipment.  Also the brigades  would  be reorganized and  divided into two regiments with Chapayev to  lead  the  Slavic group.  He  then  asked  who  wc  thought  should  lead  the  English speaking  battalions.  I  answered  him  immediately,  Jock  Cunningham  was  my  choice,  a  wcll-respected  rank-and-file  leader. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Johnson  prohahly  would  have  been  our first choice,  hut  he had left Spain on a special mission to procure weapons for the Loyalist government and  was not to return until September.) Vidal agreed and  asked  if  I  would  be  Cunningham’s  political  commissar.  I accepted.  Vidal  also  explained  at  (his  point  that  we  would be  drawn  back  from the front  for a  long-deserved  rest -  though not  right  away  and  the  plan  would  be  implemented  at  that time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">478</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">These changes would be an important victory for our men but I unfortunately  paid  far  too  little  attention  to  the  possible repercussions.  I  had  made  an  enemy  of Copic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  battalion  was  pulled  back for  a two-day rest at Alcala dc Benares. We were to take part in the May Day celebrations. At this time,  Steve  Nelson  came  up  to  the  brigade.  I  only  knew  him slightly but he had a reputation as a veteran communist organizer and  a  leader  in  the  eastern Pennsylvania anthracite  coal  mining areas.  When I met him, he relieved Fred Lutz as commissar of the Lincoln  Battalion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly  thereafter,  on  May  5,  Bob  Minor  came  over  as  a representative  of  the  Politburo  for  a  short  inspection  tour.  We filled him in on the events with Copic.  He spoke to the men on the May 3rd attempted coup of the POUM, criticizing Caballero very sharply for his attitude toward the brigades, and left a new Dodge for  my  use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the middle of May,  1  accompanied  A1 Tanz,  brigade supply officer,  to  Valencia  on a  matter of supplies  and  we learned more about the coup. At that time, the popularfront government was in a  crisis  as  a  result  of  the  POUM  action.  Caballero  had  been hesitant  to  take  military  measures  against  the  counter-revolutionary coup.  His stand lost him the government, and he resigned on  May  16. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few days later, we heard La Pasionaria speak at one of the big halls in Valencia.6 She stated the position of the communists. I went to hear  her  with  Langston  Hughes and Nicolas Guillen, the black Cuban poet.  I  had heard great oratory before,  but never anything like hers.  She appeared to me tall and stately.  She spoke in a calm manner  with  few  oratorical  flourishes,  hardly  raising her voice, It  was a damning  bill  of particulars, detailing the crimes of the Trotskyist  POUM.  She described  how under their leadership  the anarchist “uncontrollables” had set up a dictatorship of libertarian communes  in  Aragon  where  they  were  strong.  Now  instead  of agrarian reform for the benefit of the peasantry, they had imposed forced  collectivization-  this  in  the  midst  of a  bourgeois  democratic revolution. “You could win the war, but lose the revolution,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">was their slogaa  She went on and detailed how they had refused to</p>

<p class="calibre1">build the people’s army and kept the arms in the rear, preparingfor im  uprising  against  the  popular  front  government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  charged  fascist  infiltration  and  collusion  with  Franco’s agents.  Finally,  their  activities  culminated  in  the  May  3  coup which  left the Aragon front  wide open to  the fascists.  Although 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">knew very little Spanish,  I felt  I could understand every word  Of course,  I  was  acquainted  with  the  subject  and  that  helped.  La I’nsionaria  spoke eloquently,  holding the audience in  rapt  atten-lion  for  forty-five  minutes.  She  built  it  up slowly  and  carefully, point  by  point,  to  the  end  of  her  speech.  Lowering  her  voice niie  asked,  “What  are  you  going  to  do  with  such  people?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pandemonium then broke out in the hall. “Kill ’em! Shoot ’em!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  had  never seen  such  a  demonstration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  meeting broke down spontaneously into a whole number of N i n a l l   meetings throughout  the  hall;  people were bringing it down to  their  local  situations,  taking the  lessons  from  her speech.  She Ntood  poised  and  calm,  waiting for the commotion (which lasted iiftcen  minutes)  to  subside.  And  then  a  unanimous  resolution of  support  for  her  and  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Spanish ( 'ommunist Party was passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  returned to the front and pursued my duties as deputy brigade commissar.  A political commissar’s main job was to inspire morale iind  the highest spirit  of discipline and loyalty among the men for the  Republican  cause.  A  crucial  task  was  to  establish  a  mutual confidence  and  dose  comradeship  between  officers and  men.  It was  not  a  militaristic  discipline,  but  rather  one  based  on  the conscious  realization that the interest  of the people and the army were  one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  duties  required  keeping the  men fully  informed  as  to  the progress of the war and our current military objectives.  Our work extended to the smallest detail that contributed to the physical and mental well-being of the men  food, clothing, supplies, mail, rest itnd leisure. Our jobs were an integral part of the brigade command structure.  Political  officers  held  parallel  rank  with  the  military command  and  all  orders  to  the  troops  needed  the  signature  of both.  The  responsibilities  and  difficulties  of  the job  were  tremendous,  and  we  could  not  always  live up  to  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p502"></a><img src="index-502_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">480</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our Fifteenth  Brigade Commissariat was under the direction of Aitken.  We  published  a daily memo sheet,  <i class="calibre4">Our  Fight</i>,  in  English and Spanish. There was also a larger periodical,  <i class="calibre4">The Volunteer fo r</i> <i class="calibre4">Liberty, </i>  which  was published in French, German, Italian,  Polish and English. We used sound trucks for propaganda directed at the fascist  troops  calling  on  them  to join  the  fight  against  their  real enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  heroic  Frank  Ryan,  a  flamboyant  Irish  journalist  and former  officer  in  the IRA,  was assigned to work with us.  On  one occasion,  we  drove  into  Madrid  together  to  check  up  on  the printing of   <i class="calibre4">The  Volunteer</i>,  As we were driving from Grand Via, a main  street  in  Madrid,  I  realized  it  was  almost  deserted.  I wondered what was happening, Frank noticed also and exclaimed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn!  1  didn’t  realize  it  was  so  late!  It  must  be  four  o’clock!*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly  a  shell  whistled  over our  heads  and  exploded  down the street.  It was the regular daily shelling that the fascists used to demoralize  the  valiant  citizens  of  Madrid.  The  shelling  came faithfully every day at four o’clock—you could  set your watch by it.  It came from Mt. Garabitis on Casa de Campo and was soon to be the  objective  of one  of our  offensives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  men were finally withdrawn for relief to small villages near Madrid.  The reorganization plan was  put into effect and  the  men were  given  new equipment  and  clothing.  After a few weeks’ rest, our brigade  was given  orders to  move to the new front.  Our first objective  was  Villanueva  de  la  Cafiada,  a  well  fortified  town  on the Bruncte  Road.  On  the road to Villanueva, we passed many of the  Listers  and  Campesinos,  crack  troops  of the  Loyalist  army, lined up by the side of the road ready to move out. We realized this was  to  be  a  major  battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  met  with  stiff  resistance  and  became  pinned  down.  The British Battalion in the Fifteenth Brigade circled to the west to cut the road leading south to Brunete.  They crossed just to the right of us  under  machine  gun  cover  directed  by  Walter  Garland,  the young Black commander of a machine gun company. Garland had been seriously wounded at Jarama and, after recovering, was sent to the  brigade training camp at  Tarazona de la Mancha where he assisted  in the training of the Washington Battalion.  He served as</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE SPANISH  CIVIL  WAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">481</p>
<p class="calibre1">acting commander until he left for the Brunete front, at which time he  was  relieved  by  Merriman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 had made my way to the rear behind the lines to look over our positions.  As  1  approached  Garland’s  machine gun company,  he Khouted  a warning, “Get down, Harry, the snipers have a bead on that  spot!  Captain  Trail’s  just  been  hit  right  there!”  I  ducked quickly, getting out of the line of fire,  but a young Spanish soldier was  not  so  lucky.  Coming  up  behind  me,  he  was  hit  and  killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter  was  impressive,  directing  the  very  effective  cover  fire which  allowed  the  British  to cross the road.  Standing  behind  his men, much like a quarterback barking signals, he would order his gunners into action, the fire pinning down the fascists long enough for  the  British  to  make  it  across. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  Washington  Battalion  was  under  orders  to move straight nhead for a frontal attack on the town. The town was well fortified and we faced heavy machine gun fire. Our only orders were to keep advancing.  This  we  did,  but  very  slowly.  At  one  point,  Martin llourihan  (adjutant  to  Cunningham)  and  I  witnessed  a  suicidal charge  by  our  cavalry  in  which  they  suffered  terrible losses and were  forced  into a wild, disorganized  retreat,  nearly overrunning our  position.  Shaking  his  head  in  disbelief,  Hourihan,  an  old cavalry man  himself, asked, “Did  you  ever see anything like that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morse  cavalry  attacking  such  a  fortified  position?*’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hourihan  was  severely  wounded  later  that  day  in  the  final assault  on  Villanueva.  Our  attack  proceeded  very  slowly  and  it wasn’t until early evening,  after being pinned down the entire day in the sweltering heat with little water, that we forced the fascists to withdraw and were  able to  seize  the town.  But  this  delay was to have serious consequences for it gave the fascists time to figure out our objective,  to  begin concentration  of their troops and  materiel on  the  Mosquito  Heights,  the  highest  point  in  the  area.  Our offensive  had  lost  its  element  of surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In town  1 found  Cunningham’s  headquarters; he had moved in with the  British  Battalion which  was  on our right flank.  Immediately  he  informed  me  that  we  were  moving  out.  Moving  south down the Brunete road, we soon encountered the horrible sight of the bodies  of women and children lying in the road, as well as the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p504"></a><img src="index-504_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">482</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies  of members of the  British  Battalion.  Among those latter I recognized  Brown,  a  member  of the  British  Central  Committee and  formerly  of  the  Lenin  School.  He  bad  heen  a  political commissar  of one  of the  British  companies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What had  happened? A  group of fascists, fleeing the town, had seized  some  women  and  children  as  hostages,  forcing  them  to march  in  front  as  a  shield  against  the  British  fire.  Passing  the British they suddenly opened fire and threw grenades. Shoving tbe hostages aside they rushed down the road. The British* caught offguard  hy  this  ruse,  tried  to  defend  themselves.  But  to  avoid shooting tbe women  and  children, they were unable to effectively reply  and took  many  casualties as a  number  of fascists escaped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  continued to  march in the direction of Brunete to our  new attack position, avoiding the road as much as possible. Hitler's and Mussolini’s  planes  were  already  bombing  the  roads.  Towards evening we halted for the night. Cunningham was called to brigade headquarters to get the plan of action for the next day. At the time I thought it  was strange that  1  had  not been called. Jock returned shortly and unfolded  a military map,  asking me if I could read it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having  no  experience  in  military  map  reading,  I  said  no.  He abruptly folded the  map and  marched off without saying another word,  apparently  having confirmed  some  derogatory judgement of  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  mention this incident because from that time on, there seemed to be a definite cooling in our relationship. At the time, I wondered if there  were  any connection  between this action and an  incident with  Nathan  earlier that  morning.  I  had  been standing roadside waiting for the Washington Battalion to pass so I could fall in with them   Nathan,  the  chief  operations  officer  for  the  brigades, marched  past.  Out of the side of his mouth he snarled, “You'll get vours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  came so suddenly  and  so  threateningly,  that  I  was taken aback.  I  yelled after  him, “What  did  you say?”  But  he kept going without  looking  back.  Now,  putting  these  incidents  together,  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">hegan  for the first time to suspect that the hand of Col. Copic was at  work,  that  he  had  begun lining  hrigade staff up against  me  in order  to  even  the score. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  SPANISH  CIVIL WAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">483</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning we were to be in position. I had only a general idea  of the action.  I  knew our immediate ohjcctive was Mosquito Crest,  the  dominant  ridge  in  the  area,  in  the  foothills  of  the Guadarrama Mountains, overlooking Madrid.  If we took the hill, the  fascists*  positions  at  Mt.  Garabitas,  from  which  they sbelled the city daily, would  be outflanked and untenable.  Franco would be forced to abandon his salient, and the seige of Madrid would be lifted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We arose early and were in our attack positions by daylight. In our brigade sector,  the  British  Battalion was on the right, where 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">was,  the  Franco-Belgian,  Spanish,  Washington-Lincoln  and  Dimitrov  Battalions  were  all  on  our  left.  At  zero  hour,  our  men charged  up the hill with shouts, hurrahs and vivas, dashing across the Guadarrama  River, which at this time  of year was practically dry.  Under cover of machine guns, we took the first ridge.  By this time,  however,  the  surprise  element  in  the  offensive  was  lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The enemy  had decamped, moving back to the heights beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We stood looking east; ahead  of us, beyond a series of ridges and probably  3,000 meters away, loomed  Mosquito Crest,  our objective.  We  established  temporary  regimental  headquarters  on  the first ridge in a large dugout, vacated by the fascists. We established telephone  connections  with  the  brigade.  Our  orders  were  to continue  the  attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  a  slight  rest,  all  battalions  moved  forward  in  an  attack; British on the right, then Washington and Lincoln. Our regimental headquarters were closest  to  the  British  positions  and I watched the British  battalion led  by its commander Fred Copeman, leader of  the  naval  mutiny  of the   <i class="calibre4">Enver  Gordon, </i>  move forward.  Jock and  I  remained  in  our  newly  established  headquarters,  as  all the  battalions  moved  forward.  The  brigades came  under withering  fire  from  the  crest  and  were  forced  to  withdraw  with  heavy casualties. It was duringthis attack that Oliver Law was killed. The men  brought  hack  the  wounded  during  a  lull  following  the withdrawal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the next few days, a number of attacks and prohes were made in tbe direction of the crest. Now seeing what we were up to, the fascists  began a massive concentration of troops and weapon</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p506"></a><img src="index-506_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">484</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">ry,  artillery and  planes.  The air superiority which  we enjoyed the first day or two was soon gone. The fascists brought in planes from everywhere.  There were swarms  of German  Heinkels and  Italian Cazas that bombed and strafed our ground positions, flying so low they showered us with hand grenades from the sky. All this amidst the most murderous heat that I had ever experienced. The sun was a  blazing  inferno.  The  Guadarrama  River,  which  the day before had  been  a  trickle,  was  now  completely  dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By now the food and water problem was acute. The iron rations (reserve  supplies)  were  running  out,  and  we  had  lost  our rolling kitchens;  they  had  failed  to  keep  up with  our  advance and  were scattered  along the road, almost  to  Madrid—sixteen  miles away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  main duty of a commissar was to maintain morale; proper and sufficient  food  was  an  important  item  in  this  task.  With  the incessant  bombing  and  strafing,  the  whole  network  of  roads between  Madrid  and  the  front  was  disrupted  and  supplies  were prevented from moving up. 1 suggested to.lock that 1 round up the chuckwagons  and he agreed.  1 then  left the headquarters dugout, walked  down  the  hill  across  to  the  west  bank  of the  river,  and found  the  car  Minor  had  left  me  at  the  brigade  car  pool  in  the woods.  A  young  lad  assigned  to  me  as  driver  was  there  and  we drove  back  in  search  of the  kitchens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  road  1  saw  the  devastation  caused  by  the  bombing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Villages which were standing when we had passed through on our offensive were now  reduced to rubble, deserted by their surviving inhabitants.  The  sickeningly  sweet  stench  of death  filled  the  air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  bombing of the roads was so sustained that several times  we stopped,  abandoned  our  car,  and  took  refuge  in  the  woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We finally located some of the kitchens. They had pulled off the road to escape the planes. I remember running across an American mess officer from the Washington  Battalion, Sam Kaye, who had drawn  his  whole  outfit  off the  road  into  the  nearby  woods.  He remained  near the road,  peering  out from a culvert and trying to find  directions  to  our  brigade sector.  There were several more of the rolling kitchens scattered along the way. 1 told him to wait until dark and some let-up in  the heavy enemy bombing and we would then  guide them  up to  our positions.  This is what we did,  and we</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  SPANISH  CIVIL  WAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">485</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived  late  that  night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  spent  the remainder of the night with the kitchen crew.  In the morning 1 crossed the river with  a Canadian comrade.  We started up the  hill  to the  regimental  headquarters.  Halfway  up,  we were halted  by  an  car  splitting  and  earth  shaking  barrage  of  enemy artillery.  We fled  from the road and burrowed ourselves into the earth.  Wc were showered  with  stones and dust,  but  miraculously escaped  without  being harmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  had  happened? The  British,  attacking east along Bodilla Road,  ran  into the withering fire of fascist artillery massed along the  crest,  and  were  hurled  back  with  heavy  losses.  ITie  barrage lasted probably an hour. When the artillery finally stopped, we got up and continued up the hill to regimental headquarters. We found the entrance  to the  dugout blocked  by a number of dead  bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  them  I  recognized  Black,  Canadian  commander  of our new  anti-tank  group.  Charles  Goodfellow,  adjutant  commander of the British battalion lay dead in the road, cut down while trying to  reach  the  safety  of the  dugout.  We  entered to find it crowded with  men  from  the  British  battalion;  those  fortunate  enough  to escape the murderous shelling on the road. They had also dragged in  a  number  of  wounded  comrades.  In  the  dim  light  1  saw  Ted Allen,  a Canadian  newspaperman  who  was covering the Brunete offensive  for  the   <i class="calibre4">Canadian  Tribune</i>,  the  communist  paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jock Cunningham was shouting excitedly over the brigade field phone.  He  hung  up,  turned  and  continued shouting, this time at me.  “Where  the hell  have you  been?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rounding up  the  kitchens,  you  knew that,”  I  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck  the  kitchens,  you  should  have  been  here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was incensed by his comment and  even  more by  his tone.  He was  like  a  British  sergeant  dressing  down  a  recruit.  “You  know goddamn  well  you  agreed  I  should  go  get  the kitchens!” 1  yelled back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We confronted each other a few feet apart. Then Jock unleashed his crowning insult. “Aw, fuck off. You’re no good anyway. You’re scared  now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furious,  I  started  towards  him.  Ted  Allen,  sitting  close  by, jumped up and rushed between us. “Take it easy, Harry,” he urged. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p508"></a><img src="index-508_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">486</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This  can’t  be  settled  now in the midst  of battle.  You’d  better go back  to  the  brigade  and  settle  this  later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 turned and walked out of the dugout, the confrontation over. I made my way down the road towards the river. The main shelling had stopped, but there was desultory fire. Walking down the hill, 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">thought  over the events that had led up to this confrontation with Jock. Again I sensed the fine hand of Col.  Copic behind the whole matter.  There  had  been  the incident with  Major George Nathan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our relationship had  been cordial but how was 1 to account for his actions on the road up to Villanueva? Then there was the fact that 1  hadn’t  been  called  into  the  operations  meeting  and  the  map incident with  Jock  that  followed.  Something  wasn’t  right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  1 neared the river, engrossed in thought, 1 ran into Copic. He could  see  from  my expression  that  1  was  troubled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  the  matter?”  he  asked  eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 told him about the argument with Jock. “1 told you those guys were  no  good,  but  you sided with them against me,” he  beamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you going to do now?” 1 told him 1 was on my way back to  see  Steve  Nelson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  found  Steve  at  the  Lincoln  Battalion  headquarters,  He  had had  his  own  troubles;  the  Lincolns  had  also  suffered  heavy casualties,  Oliver  Law  had  been  killed.  Law’s  adjutant,  Vincent Usera, an  ex-Marine officer,  had  left  his post without permission and  had  been  dismissed from  the battalion staff by Steve and the other officers.7 Nelson  now assumed command of the battalion. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">informed him about my quarrel with Jock. His opinion was that it couldn’t  be settled then in the midst of battle.  He suggested that I return to Albacete, pick up Lawrence and  Bender, and bring them up to the front within the next few days. Then we could find time with leading American comrades at the front to have a meeting on the  situation  and  decide  what  to  do.  This  made sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The meeting took place a few days later, when the battalion was given  rest  and  drawn  back  on the other side of the river.  Present were  Steve  Nelson;  Mirko  Mirkovicz,  commander  of the  Washington  Battalion;  Dave  Mates; two or three other comrades from the  front;  Bill  Lawrence  and  George  Bender  from  Albacete;  and myself. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  meeting,  Steve  repeated  what  he  had  said earlier.  The issue  couldn’t  be  settled  at that time,  in  the midst  of battle. Jock Cunningham,  he  pointed  out,  was  in  effective  command  of  the regiment.  Thus he felt that  I  should  be withdrawn from the front and things worked  out  later.  This was unanimously agreed upon, On  my  own  part,  I  felt  it  was  the  only  possible decision  that could  be  made under  the circumstances, but nevertheless, 1 didn’t like it.  1 left the front  bitter and frustrated.  But now 1 had time to understand how this situation had come about. I had led the fight for improvement of conditions for the Americans and the removal of Copic. The main responsibility for the February 27 slaughter at Jarama  was  Gal’s,  the  division  commander.  Copic,  however, shared in it as brigade commander and became the main apologist for Gal  consequently  he was the immediate target for the men’s anger.  The  struggle  for  changes  in  the  brigade  brought  about improved  conditions,  reorganization  and  a  marked  boost  in morale.  It also meant a  loss of prestige for Copic, even though he remained  as  commander, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copic was aware of my role in all of this.  At the front, where his power  and  influence  were  greatest,  he  was  at  last  able to  move against  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnson had been the only American on the brigade staff. When he left the front on a special mission, Nathan took his place. Copic easily  brought  Nathan  into  his  inner  circle  which,  I  reasoned, enabled  him  to  clear  the  way  to  isolate  me  in  the  brigade leadership.  My confrontation with Jock was undoubtedly the end result  of this effort  to  regain  his  lost  prestige. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly after the meeting at the front, Bob Minor arrived back in  Spain,  this time as official representative of the CPUSA,  1 was happy  to  see him.  He  listened  sympathetically  to  my  side  of tbe story  and  told  me  that  they  heard  1  was  having  difficulties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder  had said that if 1 couldn’t see  my way through, 1 should come  back  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  agreed  that  my  withdrawal  was  the  only  thing  that  could have been done at the time, and that at some future time it might be possible  to  work  me  into  some  position  at  the  front.  In  the meantime,  he  suggested  that  1  might  consider  taking  over  as</p>

<p class="calibre1">political  commissar  in  Madrid.  I  rejected  this  latter  proposal, considering it a demotion.  By this time, I was already beginning to feel that  I was getting the short end of the deal.  Rather than go to Madrid,  I  stayed in Albacete with Lawrence  and  Bender, accompanying  them  on  their  rounds  of  hospitals,  checking  up  on Americans.  Bob Minor took me to Valencia and introduced me to leaders  from  other  countries  and  from  Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  battle  of Brunete ended on July 28.  Of the 360 men in the British  battalion,  only  thirty-seven  were  left  on  the  line.  The remainder  were  either  killed  or  wounded.  The  Franco-Belgian battalion had eighty-eight left. The Dimitrovs had ninety-three left from 450. Only  125 Spaniards remained effective out of400. There had  been  two  American  battalions  with a total of 900 men.  Now there  were  280  effectives  who  were  merged  into  one  battalion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They pulled  back to rest in villages near Madrid, the same villages from which they had left for the offensive.  Officers killed included Nathan.  A number of volunteers were given “extended leaves" to return  home  if they  wanted.  Among those repatriated were Jock Cunningham  and  Ait ken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  now,  for  the  first  time,  an  American ascendency in the brigade.  Although Copic remained commander, Steve Nelson replaced  Aitken  as political commissar;  Merriman,  now a major, became  chief of staff,  replacing the German Col.  Klaus.  Gal was dismissed.  Johnson  returned  to  command  the  training  camp  at Tarazona. The brigade went on to Terruel and then to the Aragon front. It became clear to me that after all this reorganization, all of which  passed  me  over,  there was  no  place for me in the brigade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minor  raised  again  the question  of repatriation  and  I  agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fighting  in  Spain  continued  for  nearly  eighteen  months after  I left,  the internationals fought  many  more battles and their heroism and  fighting spirit  became  legendary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Loyalist  Spain  was  not  able  to  overcome  the  military superiority  of the  fascists,  a  condition  forced  on  it  by  the  nonintervention  pact.  On  March  28,  1939,  Madrid  fell,  ending  the three  years  of  bitter  fighting.  Republican  Spain  was  clearly  a victim  of  the  western  imperialists’  policy  of  appeasement.  The fascist  victory  in  Spain  was  another  step toward  World  War  II. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I left Spain  bitter and  frustrated.  I was disappointed that I had not  fully  anticipated  nor  was  1  able  to overcome the difficulties encountered  there.  It  was  for  me  a  personal  crisis,  but  nothing compared  to  what  I  was  faced  with  on  returning  home. </p>
