<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The  Fight  for  a  Correct  Line</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards the end of 1927, Nasanov returned to the Soviet Union after  a  sojourn  in  the  United  States  as  the  representative  of the Young Communist  International.  1  had  known him  briefly in the Stdtes  before  my  departure  for  Russia.  Nasanov  was  one  of a group  of YC1  workers  who  had  been sent  on  missions to several countries.  He  had  considerable  experience  with  respect  to  the national  and  colonial  question  and  was  considered  an expert on these  matters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasanov’s  observations  had  convinced  him  that  U.S.  Blacks were  essentially  an  oppressed  nation  whose  struggle  for equality would  ultimately  take  an  autonomous  direction  and  that  the content  of the  Black liberation  movement was the completion  of the  agrarian  and  democratic revolution  in the South—a struggle which  was  left  unresolved  by  the  Civil  War  and  betrayal  of Reconstruction. Therefore, it was the duty of the Party to channel the movement in a revolutionary direction by raising and supporting  the  slogan  of  the  right  of  self-determination  for  Afro-Americans  in  the  Black  Belt,  the  area  of  their  greatest  concentration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon his return, Nasanov sought me out and it was he, I believe, who  first  informed  me  that  I  had  been  elected  to  the  National Committee of the YCL back in the States. In the months ahead, we were to become close friends. Through him, I met a number of YC1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">people,  mostly  Soviet  comrades  who  held  the  same  position  as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a><img src="index-227_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">219</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasanov did on the national question. They seemed to be pushing to have the matter reviewed at the forthcoming Sixth Congress of the  Comintern.  And  as  it  later  became  clear  to  me,  they  were anxious  to  recruit  at  least  one  Black  to  support  their position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  have indicated before, the position was not entirely new to me.  1 was present at the meeting of the YCL District Committee in Chicago in 1924 when Bob Mazut(then YC1 rep to the U.S.),at the behest  of Zinoviev,  had  raised the question  of self-determination At  that  time,  he  had  been  shouted down  by the white comrades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(See  Chapter Four.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sen  Katayama had told us  Black  KUTVA students  that Lenin had regarded U.S. Blacks as an oppressed nation and referred us to his  draft  resolution  on  the  national  and  colonial  question  which was  adopted  by  the Second  Congress  of the Comintern in  1920.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  and  other  Black  students  had  also  told  me  that  they  got  a similar  impression  from their meeting with  Stalin at  the  Kremlin shortly  after  their arrival  in  the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  of this  seemed tentative to  me.  No one had elaborated the position  fully  and  Nasanov  was  the  first  person  I  met  who attempted to  argue it  definitively.  But all of these arguments, and especially Nasanov's prodding, set me to thinking  and confronted me with the need to apply concretely my newly-acquired Marxist-Leninist  knowledge  on  the  national-colonial  question  to  the condition  of Blacks  in  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  me,  the  idea  of  a  Black  nation  within  U.S.  boundaries seemed  far-fetched  and  not  consonant  with  American  reality.  I saw  the  solution  through  the  incorporation  of Blacks  into  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">society on the basis of complete equality, and only socialism could bring this to pass. There was no doubt in my mind that the path to freedom for us Blacks led directly to socialism, uncluttered by any interim  stage  of self-determination or Black political power.  The unity of Black and white workers against the common enemy, U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalism,  was  the  motor leading toward the dual goal of Black freedom  and  socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  felt  that  it  was  difficult  enough  to  build  this  unity,  without adding  to  it  the  gratuitous  assumption  of a  non-existent  Black nation, with  its implication of a separate state on U.S. soil. To do</p>

<p class="calibre1">220</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,  1  felt,  was  to  create  new  and  unnecessary  roadblocks  to  the already  difficult  path  to  Black  and  white  unity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Socialism,  I  reasoned,  was  not  in  contradiction  to  the  movement  for  Black  cultural  identity,  expressed  in the cultural renaissance of the twenties and  in Garvey’s emphasis on race pride and history  (which  I  regarded  as  one  of the  positive  aspects  of that movement).  Socialism  for  U.S.  Blacks  did  not  imply  loss  of cultural  identity  any  more  than  it  did  for the Jews  of the Soviet Union, among whom I had witnessed the proliferation of the positive  features  of Jewish  culture... theater,  literature and  language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Jews  were  not  considered  a  nation  because they were not concentrated  in  any  definite  territory;  they  were  regarded  as  a national  minority  and  Birobidzhan  was  set  aside  as  a  Jewish autonomous  province.  Such  a  bolstering  of self-respect,  dignity and  self-assertion  on  the  part  of a  formerly  oppressed  minority people  was  a  necessary  stage  in  the  development  of a  universal culture which would amalgamate the  best features of all national groups.  This  was  definitely  the  policy  of the  Soviet  Union  with regard  to  formerly  oppressed  nationalities  and  ethnic groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  the  Jews,  I  reasoned,  the  position  of  U.S.  Blacks  was that  of an  oppressed  race,  though  at  the time  I  am  sure  I would have been hard-pressed to define precisely what was meant by that phrase.  The  main  factor in the oppression of Jews under the Czar had been the religious factor; the main factor with U.S, Blacks was race.  Blacks  lacked  some  of  the  essential  attributes  of  a  nation which had been defined by Stalin in his classic work,  <i class="calibre4">Marxism and</i> <i class="calibre4">the National  Question.1</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  assuredly,  one  could  argue  that  among  Blacks  there existed elements of a special culture and also a common language (English).  But this did not add up to a nation, I reasoned.  Missing was  the  all-important  aspect  of a  national  territory.  Even  if one agreed  that  the  Black  Belt,  where  Blacks  were  largely  concentrated,  rightfully  belonged  to  them,  they  were  in  no  geographic position  to  assert  their  right  of self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I could see many analogies between the national problem in the old  Czarist  Empire  and  the  problem  of  U.S.  Blacks,  but  the analogy  floundered  on  this  question  of territory.  For the subject</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a><img src="index-229_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">221</p>
<p class="calibre1">nations  of  the  old  Czarist  Empire  were  situated  either  on  the border of the oppressing Great Russian nation or were completely outside it.  But American Blacks were set down in the very midst of the  oppressing  white  nation,  the  strongest  capitalist  power  on earth.  Faced  with  this,  it  was  no  wonder  that  most  nationalist movements  up  until  then  had  taken  the  road  of a  separate  state outside  the  United  States.  How  then  could  one  convince  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacks that the right of self-determination was a realistic program? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasanov and his young friends answered my arguments over the course  of a  series  of discussions  and  were quick  to  pick  out the flaws  in  my  position,  They  contended  that  I  was  guilty  of  an ahistoric  approach  with  respect  to  the  elements  of nationhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly,  some  of  the  attributes  of  a  nation  were  weakly developed  in  the  case  of U.S.  Blacks.  But that was  the case with most oppressed peoples  precisely because the imperialist policy of national  oppression  is  directed  towards  artificially  and  forcibly retaining the economic and cultural backwardness of the colonial peoples  as  a  condition  for their super-exploitation.  My  mistake had been to ignore Lenin’s dictum that in the epoch of imperialism it  was  essential  to  differentiate  between  the  oppressor  and  the oppressed  nations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  further  contended  that  I  had  presented  the  matter  as though self-determination were solely a question for Blacks.  I had therefore  separated  the  Black  rebellion  from  the  struggle  for socialism in the  United States.  In fact, it was a constituent part of the latter struggle or, more precisely, a special phase of the struggle of the  American  working class  for socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  argument  added  up  to a defense of the current  position  of the  U.S.  Parly,  albeit  I  had  embellished  the  position  somewhat against Nasanov’s criticisms.  Up to this point,  the Black students had  not  challenged  the  Party’s line on  Afro-American work,  We reasoned  that  the  Party’s  default  in  the  work  among Blacks was not the result of an incorrect line, but came from a failure to carry out  in practice its declared  line.  We believed that  this failure was due  to  an  underestimation  of  the  importance  of  work  among Blacks, which came from an underestimation of the revolutionary potential of the struggle of the Black masses for equality.  All this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a><img src="index-230_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">222</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">resulted  from the persistence of remnants of white racist ideology within  the  ranks  of  the  Party,  including  some  of  its  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasanov  and  some  of  his  friends  agreed  with  us  that  the American CP did underestimate the revolutionary potential of the Black  struggle  for  equality.  But,  they  maintained,  this  underestimation  came  from  a  fundamentally  incorrect  sodal-dcmo-cralic line, rather than from white chauvinism. They said that 1 had stood  the whole  matter on its head:  I  had  presented  the incorrect policies  as  the  result  of  subjective  white  chauvinist  attitudes; whereas,  they  pointed  out  that  the  while  chauvinist  attitudes persisted  precisely  because  the  Party’s  line  was  fundamentally incorrect  in that it  denied  the national character of the question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our  American  comrades  seem  to  think  that  only  the  direct struggle for socialism is revolutionary,” they told me, “and that the national  movement  detracts  from  that  struggle  and  is  therefore reactionary.” This, they pointed out,  was  an  American version of the  “pure  proletarian  revolution”  concept;  they  referred  me  to Lenin’s  polemic  against  Radek  on  the  question  of  self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Bolsheviks  also criticized  my formulation  of the  matter as primarily a race question. To call the matter a race question, they said,  was  to  fall  into  the  bourgeois  liberal  trap  of regarding the fight  for  equality  as  primarily  a  fight against  racial prejudices of whites.  This  slurred  over  the  economic  and  social  roots  of the question  and  obscured  the  question  of the  agrarian  democratic revolution in the South, which was pivotal to the struggle for Black equality  throughout  the  country.  They  pointed  out  that  it  was wrong to counterpose the struggle for equality to the struggle for self-determination.  For  in  fact,  in  the  South,  self-determination for Blacks (political power in their own hands) was the guarantee of equality, </p>
<p class="calibre1">HISTORY  OF  THE  QUESTION  IN  THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  these  discussions  with  my  young  friends,  which  extended over  the  course  of several  months,  1  became keenly aware of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a><img src="index-231_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">223</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaps  in  my  understanding  of  Marxist-Leninist  theory  on  the national-colonial  question.  1  was  to  find, as Nasanov and  others had  indicated, that  the  idea of Blacks as an oppressed nation was not  new  in  the  Comintern.  Though  Stalin  was  undoubtedly  the person  pushing the position at the time, it had not originated with him,  but  with  Lenin  himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  first  appeared  in  Lenin’s  “Draft  Theses  on  the  National-Colonial Question” which he submitted to the Second Congress of the  Comintern in  1920. The draft, which was later adopted, called upon  the  communist  parties  to “render direct  aid  to  the  revolutionary  movements  among  the  dependent  and  underprivileged nations (for  example,  Ireland,  the  American  Negroes,  etc.)  and in  the  colonies.”3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  have  argued  that  Lenin’s  reference  to  U.S.  Blacks as  a subject  nation  was  merely  a  tentative  deduction.  When  he submitted  his  draft,  he  asked  the  delegates  for  opinions  and suggestions  on  fifteen  points,  one  of  which  was  “Negroes  in America.”4</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  recorded, however, that the Colonial Commission of the congress,  which  Lenin  himself  headed  and  in  which  Sen  Katayama  was  a  leading  member,  held  lengthy  discussions  on  the question  of U.S,  Blacks,5</p>
<p class="calibre1">John  Reed,  the  American  author,  was  a  delegate  and  participated  in  the  discussion,  apparently  in  opposition  to  Lenin’s formulations.  In  fact,  he  made two speeches,  one in the commission and one to the congress, contending that the problem of U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacks  was  that  of “both  a  strong  race  movement  and  a  strong proletarian  workers’  movement  which  is  rapidly  developing  in class  consciousness.”6  Equating  all  national  movements  among Blacks  to  Garvey’s Back to Africa separatism,  he contended  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">“a movement which struggles for a separate national existence has no success among the Negroes, like the‘Back to Africa* movement, for  example.... ”  and  that  Blacks  “consider themselves  above  all Americans, they feel at home in the United States. This makes the tasks  of communists  very  much easier.”7</p>
<p class="calibre1">But despite Reed’s objections, the reference to American Blacks as  an  oppressed  nation  remained  in  the  resolution  as  finally</p>

<p class="calibre1">224</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">adopted.  For Lenin’s thesis was not something spun out of thin air, but  was  the result  of a serious study of the question.  This is clear from  his  work  “New  Data  on  the  Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture,” which spoke about the United States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this work, published in  1915 (and based on the U.S. Census of 1910),  Lenin viewed  the question of Blacks in the South as one of an  uncompleted  agrarian  and  bourgeois  democratic  revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  drew  attention  to  the  remarkable  similarity  between  the economic  positions of the South’s  Black tenants and  the emancipated serfs in the agrarian centers of Russia, pointing out that both groups  were  not  tenants  in  the  European  civilized  sense,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">“....semi-slaves,  share-croppers...”8</p>
<p class="calibre1">Emphasizing  the  absence  of  elementary  democratic  rights among  Blacks,  he  alluded  to  the  South  as  “the  most  stagnant arep, where the masses are subjected to the greatest degradation and oppression...a kind of prison where (these ‘emancipated’ Negroes) are hemmed in, isolated, and deprived of fresh air.”9 These kinds of conditions,  the  lot  of the vast majority  of U.S.  Blacks, undoubtedly  led  I&gt;enin  to  conclude  that  their  movement  for  “emancipation”  would  take  a  national  revolutionary  direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conclusive proof of Lenin’s thinking at the time with respect to U.S.  Blacks can be found in an uncompleted work written in 1917, though  not  available  until  1935.  The  work,  “Statistics  and Sociology,”  was  begun  in  the  early  part  of  1917,  but  was interrupted  by  the  February  Revolution  and  never resumed.10</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  section  of the  manuscript  referring  to  U.S.  Blacks,  he drew  a  clear  distinction  between  their  positions  and  that  of the foreign-born  immigrants,  that  is  between  the white foreign-born assimilables  and  the  Black  unassimilables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the United States, the Negroes (and also the Mulattos and Indians)  account  for  only  11.1  per  cent.  They  should  be classed  as  an  oppressed  nation,  for the equality won in the Civil War of 1861-1865 and guaranteed by the Constitution of the republic was in many respects increasingly curtailed in the chief Negro areas  (the South) in connection with the transition from the progressive,  pre-monopoly capitalism of 1860-</p>

<p class="calibre1">225</p>
<p class="calibre1">1870 to the  reactionary,  monopoly capitalism (imperialism) of the  new era."11</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas  with the white foreign-bom immigrants,  Lenin observed that  the  speed  of  development  of  capitalism  in  America  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">“produced  a  situation  in  which  vast  national  differences  are speedily  and  fundamentally,  as  nowhere  else  in  the  world, smoothed  out  to  form  a  single ‘American  nation.’  ”12</p>
<p class="calibre1">All  of this  shows  that  the  idea  that  U.S.  Blacks  comprise  an oppressed  nation was  neither a temporary nor tentative formulation  on  Lenin’s  part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  thesis  of  the  Second  Congress,  Reed’s  views  - </p>
<p class="calibre1">reflecting as they did  the position of the young American Party— </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  to  persist  in the  U.S.  without serious  challenge through  the Fifth  Congress  of  the  Comintern.  The  Third  Congress  of  1921 </p>
<p class="calibre1">recorded  no  discussion  with  respect  to  the  character  of  the problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Fourth Congress in  1922 also did not seriously discuss the point.  This  meeting,  however,  marked  the  first  appearance  of Black  delegates  to  the  Comintern.  They were  Otto Huiswood  as regular Party  delegate,  and  the poet  Claude  McKay  as  a  special fraternal delegate.  It  was  also the first congress to set up a Negro Commission,  and  extended  discussions  took  place  on  the thesis brought  in  by the commission which characterized the position of U.S.  Blacks  as  an  aspect  of the colonial  question.  It stressed  the special  role  of  American  Blacks  in  support  of  the  liberation struggles  of  Africa,  Central  and  South  America  and  the  Caribbean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thesis of the Fourth Congress did add a new, international dimension to the question, but it did not challenge the Party’s basic anti-self-determination  position.  This  position  was  stressed  in  a speech  by  Huiswood  (Billings)  which  called  the  Afro-American question  “another  phase  of the  racial  and  colonial  question,” an essentially  economic  problem  which  was  “intensified  by  the friction which  exists  between  the white  and  black  races.” 1*</p>
<p class="calibre1">1</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  discussion  of the  character of the question came up  in  the Fifth  Congress  in  1924,  this  time  in  connection  with  the  Draft Program  of the Communist International.  For the first time since</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a><img src="index-234_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">226</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Second  Congress,  the  discussion  centered  directly  on  the character  of  the  question  as  an  oppressed  nation  and  the appropriateness  of the  slogan  of the  right  of self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">August  Thalheimer  (the  German  head  of the Commission  on the  Draft  Program)  reported  that  “the  slogan  of  the  right  of self-determination cannot solve all national questions.” Such is the case  in  the  United  States,  “where  there  is  an  extraordinarily mixed population” and where the “race question” is also involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  he pointed  out, “the  Program Commission  was  of the opinion  that  the  slogan  of  right  of  self-determination  must  be supplemented  by  another slogan:  ‘Equal  Rights for all Nationalities  and  Races/  ” 14</p>
<p class="calibre1">Representing  the  U.S.  at  the  Fifth  Congress,  John  Pepper supported this anti-self-determination position. According to him, the United States was a country in which the different nationalities could  not  be separated.  Self-determination  was  not  appropriate; Blacks in the  U.S.  did  not  want  it.  “They do  not  want to set  up a separate  state  inside  the  U.S.A.,” and  they wish to  remain  inside the  U S.,  not  leave  it  for  Africa.  To  the  demand  of  “social equality,”  he  held  that  “we  should  change  these  words  to  the following:  full  equality  in  every  respect.”15</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovett  Fort-Whiteman,  the  sole  Black  delegate,  apparently supported  Pepper’s position and gave his standard speech (which 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">was to hear a number of times in the States).  He stressed the racial aspect of the problem and called for a special communist approach to  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There appeared  to  be no  opposition  to the draft program,  but, after all, it was only the first version. The program in its final form was to be discussed and adopted at the Sixth Congress. Apparently  Zinoviev and others in the Cl leadership were not satisfied with the  formulation  that  had  rejected  self-determination  for  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacks.  Zinoviev  had  instructed  Bob  Mazut  to  investigate  the question  while  on  his  assignment  to  the  U.S.,  immediately following the congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  was  the  situation  following  the  Fifth  Congress.  The question can  be raised as to why the U.S.  Party’s position was not seriously  challenged  during  this  whole  period  and  why  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">227</p>
<p class="calibre1">proponents  in  the  Comintern  of  the  self-determination  thesis failed  to  press  for  their  position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their reluctance in this regard, I presume, was because they did not  want to push their position against the unanimous opposition of the American Party, including its Black members.  After all, the Comintern  was  a  voluntary  union  of communist  parties  which operated under democratic-centralism.  It was not the policy of the Comintern  leadership  to  arbitrarily  force  positions  on  member parties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1928:  A  REEXAMINATION  OF THE  QUESTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">How  are  we  to  account  then  for  the  renewed  interest  in  the Afro-American  question  among certain  influential leaders  of the Comintern  on the eve of the Sixth Congress? Why the drive to reopen the question? The answer lies in the changed world situation: the sharpened crisis of the world capitalist system, consequent on the breakdown of partial capitalist stabilization; the beginning of a deepening  economic  depression  in  Europe;  and  the  continued upsurge of the colonial revolutions in China, India and Indonesia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These harbingers of the new period were pointed out by Stalin at the  Fifteenth  Congress  of the  CPSU  in  early  December  1927,  in which he referred to  the “collapsing stabilization” of capitalism.16</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was to  be a period  of revolutionary struggle.  In order to lead these struggles, an attack on right opportunism was required in the practice  and  work  of the  communist  parties.  It  was  a  period  in which  the  national  and  colonial  question  was  to  acquire  a  new urgency.  The  Cl  paid  special  attention  to  the fight against those views  which  liquidated  or  downplayed  the  importance  of  the question.  In this context, the Comintern felt that the establishment of a revolutionary line on the Afro-American question was key if the  CPUSA  was to  lead  the joint struggle of the Black and  white working  masses  in  the  coming  period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The low status of the CP’s Negro work itself was another factor pressing for a radical policy review. There had been no progress in</p>

<p class="calibre1">this  work,  despite  the  prodding  of  the  Comintern.  As  already mentioned,  the  highly  touted  American  Negro  Labor  Congress had  failed  to  even  get  off the  ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a speech at the Sixth Congress, James Ford counted nineteen communications  from  the Comintern to the U.S.  Party on Negro work,  none  of  which  had  been  put  into  effect  or  brought before  the  Party.  He  further  observed  that  “we  have  no  more than  50  Negroes  in  our  Party,  out  of  the  12  million  Negroes in  America.”17</p>
<p class="calibre1">All  of  these  factors  strengthened  the  determination  of  the Comintern to  make the Sixth Congress  the arena for a drastic reevaluation  of work  and  policy  in  this  area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  winter  of  1928,  preparations  were already afoot for the Sixth Congress  which was to convene the following summer. The Anglo-American  Secretariat  of  the  Cl  set  up  a  special  sub-committeee  on  the Negro  question  which would  prepare  a  draft resblution  for  the  official  Negro  Commission  of the  Congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  recall,  the  subcommittee  consisted  of  Nasanov  and  five students:  four  Blacks (including my brother Otto and myself) and one white student, Clarence Hathaway, from the Lenin School. In addition,  there were some ex-officio members:  Profintern rep Bill Dunne and Comintern rep Bob Minor.  They seldom attended our sessions.  James  Ford,  who  was  then  assigned  to  the  Profintern, also  attended  some  sessions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our subcommittee met and broke the subject down into topics; each of us accepted one as his assignment to research and report on to the committee as  a whole. The high point in the discussion was the  report  of  my  brother  Otto  on  Garvey’s  Back  to  Africa movement.  In  his  report,  he  concluded  that  the  nationalism expressed  in  that  movement  had  no  objective  base  in  the economic, social and political conditions of U.S. Blacks. It was, he asserted,  a  foreign  importation  artificially  grafted  onto  the freedom movement of U.S.  Blacks by the West Indian nationalist, Garvey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.  Blacks, Otto concluded, were not an oppressed  nation but an  oppressed  racial  minority.  The  long-range goal  of the  movement  was  not  the  right  of  self-determination  but  complete</p>

<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">229</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic*  social  and  political  equality  to  be  won  through  a revolutionary alliance of Blacks and class-conscious white labor in a  joint  struggle  for  socialism  against  the  common  enemy*  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up  to  that  point,  I  was  still  not  certain  as  regarded  the applicability of the right of self-determination to the problems of Blacks  in  the  U.S., but  my  misgivings  about  the slogan had been shaken  somewhat  by  the  series  of discussions I  had  had  with my Russian friends,  Otto, in  his  report,  had  merely restated the CP’s current  position.  But  somehow,  against  the  background  of our discussion  of  the  Garvey  movement,  the  inadequacy  of  that position  stood  out  like  a  sore  thumb.  Otto,  however,  had  done more than simply restate the position; he brought out into the open what  had  been  implicit  in  the  Party’s  position  all  along.  That is, that  any type  of nationalism  among  Blacks  was  reactionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  view,  it  occurred  to  me,  was  the  logical  outcome  of any position which saw only the “pure proletarian” class struggle as the sole  revolutionary  struggle  against  capitalism.  The  Party  had traditionally  considered the  Afro-American question as that of a persecuted  racial  minority.  They  centered  their  activity  almost exclusively  on  Blacks  as  workers  and  treated  the  question  as basically a simple trade union matter, underrating other aspects of the struggle.  The struggle for equal rights  was seen as a diversion that  would  obscure  or overshadow  the  struggle for  socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how could one wage a fight against white chauvinism from that position? I thought at the time that viewing everything in light of  the  trade  union  question  would  lead  to  a  denial  of  the revolutionary  potential  of  the  struggle  of the  whole  people  for equality.  Otto’s  rejection  of  nationalism  as  an  indigenous  trend brought  these  points  out  sharply  in  my  mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  discussion,  I  pointed  out  that  Otto’s  position  was  not merely a rejection of Garvevism but also a denial of nationalism as a  legitimate  trend  in  the Black  freedom  movement,  I  felt  that  it amounted to throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  With my insight  sharpened  by  previous  discussions,  I  argued  further that the  nationalism  reflected  in  the  Garvey  movement  was  not  a foreign  transplant,  nor  did  it spring full-blown from  the brow  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jove.  On the contrary, it was an indigenous product, arising from the soil  of Black super-exploitation and oppression in  the United States.  It expressed the yearnings of millions of Blacks for a nation of their  own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  pursued  this  logic,  a totaLly new thought  occurred to me, and  for  me it  was  the clincher.  The Garvey  movement is dead, I reasoned,  but  not  Black  nationalism.  Nationalism,  which Garvey diverted  under  the  slogan  of  Back  to  Africa,  was  an  authentic trend, likely to flare up again in periods of crisis and stress. Such a movement  might  again  fall  under  the  leadership  of  utopian visionaries  who  would  seek  to  divert  it  from  the struggle against the  main  enemy,  U.S.  imperialism,  and  on  to  a  reactionary separatist path. The only way such a diversion ofthe struggle could be  forestalled  was  by  presenting  a  revolutionary  alternative  to Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  the slogan  of “Back to Africa,”  I  argued,  we must  counterpoise  the  slogan  of “right  of self-determination  here  in  the  Deep South.” Our slogan for the U.S, Black rebellion therefore must be the  “right  of  self-determination  in  the  South,  with  full  equality throughout  the  country,”  to  be  won  through  revolutionary alliance  with  politically  conscious  white  workers  against  the common  enemy—U.S.  imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasanov  was  seated  across  the  table  from  me  during  this discussion and, elated at my presentation, he demonstratively rose to  shake  my  hand,  I  was  the  first  American  communist  (with perhaps  the  exception  of Briggs)  to  support  the thesis  that  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacks  constituted  an  oppressed  nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  day,  Nasanov  and  I  submitted  a  resolution  to  the subcommittee incorporating our views. We couldn’t get a majority but we had Hathaway’s support, as I remember. It was agreed that the resolution  be submitted to the Anglo-American Secretariat as the views of those who subscribed  to it, and those who disagreed with  it  would  present  their  own  views. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only really persistent opposition  in  the subcommittee, as I remember,  came  from  Otto;  the  other  students  were  somewhat ambivalent  on  the  question.  I  attributed  much  of  this  to  Sik’s influence, since he had already begun to develop his position which</p>

<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">231</p>
<p class="calibre1">held  that  the  question  of U.S.  Blacks  was  a “race”  question  and that  Blacks should not demand self-determination, but simply full social  and  political  equality.  His  theories  were  later  used  by the Lovestoncites  and  others  who  opposed  the  self-determination position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  my  hesitations  were  overcome,  the  whole  theory  fell logically  into  place.  Here  is  the  full  analysis  as  1  came  to understand  it.  The  thesis  that  called  for  the  right  of  self-determination  is  supported  by  a  serious  economic-historical analysis  of  U.S.  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The evolution  of American  Blacks  as an oppressed nation was begun in slavery.  In the final analysis, however, it was the result of the  unfinished  bourgeois  democratic revolution  of the Civil War and  the  betrayal  of  Reconstruction  through  the  Hayes-Tilden (Gentlemen’s)  Agreement  of  1877. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  betrayal  was  followed  by  withdrawal  of  federal  troops and  the  unleashing of counter-revolutionary terror,  including the massacre  of  thousands  of  Blacks  and  the  overthrow  of  the Reconstruction governments which had been based on an alliance of Blacks,  poor whites and carpetbaggers.  The result was that the Black freedmen, deserted  by their former  Republican allies,  were left  without  land.  Their newly-won rights were destroyed with the abrogation  of the Thirteenth,  Fourteenth  and  Fifteenth Amendments,  and  they  were  thrust  back  upon  the  plantations  of their former  masters  in  a  position  but  little  removed  from  chattel bondage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  revolution  had  stopped  short  of a  solution  to  the  crucial land question; there was neither confiscation of the big plantations of  the  former  slaveholding  class,  nor  distribution  of  the  land among  the Negro  freedmen  and  poor  whites.  It  was  around this issue  of land  for  the  freedmen that the revolutionary democratic wave of  Radical  Reconstruction  beat  in  vain  and  finally  broke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The advent  of imperialism, the epoch of trusts and monopolies at  the  turn  of  the  century,  froze  the  Blacks  in  their  post-Reconstruction  position;  landless,  semi-slaves  in  the  South.  It blocked the road to fusion of Blacks and whites into one nation on the basis of equality and put the final seal on the special oppression</p>

<p class="calibre1">232</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK.  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Blacks. The path towards equality and freedom via assimilation was foreclosed by these events, and the struggle for Black equality thenceforth was ultimately bound to take a national revolutionary direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under conditions of imperialist and racist oppression, Blacks in the  South  were  to  acquire  all  the  attributes  of a  subject  nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are a people set apart  by a common ethnic origin, economically interrelated in various classes, united by a common historical experience,  reflected  in  a  special  culture  and  psychological makeup.  The  territory of this subject  nation  is the Black Belt, an area  encompassing  the  Deep  South,  which,  despite  massive outmigrations,  still contained (and does to this day) the country's largest  concentration  of  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus,  imperialist  oppression  created  the  conditions  for  the eventual rise of a national liberation movement  with its base in the South.  The content  of this movement would be the completion of the agrarian democratic revolution in the South;  that is, the right of  self-determination  as  the  guarantee  of  complete  equality throughout  the  country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This new analysis defined the status of Blacks in the north as an unassimilable national minority  who cannot escape oppression by fleeing the  South.  The  shadow of the plantation falls upon them throughout  the  country,  as the  semi-slave  relations  in  the  Black Belt  continually  reproduce  Black  inequality  and  servitude  in  all walks  of  life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  are  certain  singular  features  of  the  submerged  Afro-American  nation  which  differentiate  it  from  other  oppressed nations  and  which  have  made  the  road  towards  national  consciousness and identity difficult and arduous. Afro-Americans are not only “a nation within a nation," but a captive nation, suffering a  colonial-type  oppression  while  trapped  within  the  geographic bounds of one of the world's most powerful imperialist countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacks were forced  into the stream of U.S. history in a peculiar manner,  as  chattel  slaves,  and  are  victims  of  an  excruciatingly destructive system of oppression and persecution, due not only to the  economic  and  social  survivals  of  slavery,  but  also  to  its ideological  heritage,  racism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a><img src="index-241_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">233</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Afro-American  nation  is  also  unique  in  that  it  is  a  new nation  evolved  from  a  people  forcibly  transplanted  from  their original  African  homeland.  A  people comprised  of various tribal and  linguistic  groups,  they  are  a  product  not  of  their  native African  soil,  but  of the  conditions  of their  transplantation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  overwhelming,  stifling  factor  of  race,  the  doctrine  of inherent  Black: inferiority perpetuated  by ruling class ideologues, has  sunk  deep  into  the  thinking  of  Americans.  It  has  become endemic,  permeating the  entire  structure of U.S.  life.  Given  this, Blacks  could  only  remain  permanently  unabsorbed  in  the  new world's  “melting pot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  race factor has also left its stigma  on the consciousness of the  Black  nation,  creating a  powerful  mystification  about  Black Americans which has served to obscure their objective status as an oppressed  nation.  It  has  twisted  the  direction  of  the  Afro-American  liberation  movement  and  scarred  it  while  still  in  its embryonic  state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  the objective base for equality and freedom via direct integration was foreclosed by the defeat of Reconstruction and the advent  of  the  U.S.  as  an  imperialist  power,  bourgeois  assimilationist  illusions  were  continued  into  the  new  era.  They  were nurtured and kept alive by the nascent Black middle class and the liberal  detachment  of the  white  bourgeoisie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conditions,  however,  were  maturing  for  the  rise  of  a  mass nationalist movement. This movement was to burst with explosive force upon the political scene in the period following World War I, with  the  rise  of  the  Garvey  movement.  The  potentially  revolutionary  movement  of  Black  toilers  was  diverted  into  utopian reactionary channels  of a  peaceful  return  to  Africa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  period  of bourgeois  democratic  revolutions  in the United States  ended  with  the defeat  of democratic  Reconstruction.  The issue  of  Black  freedom  was  carried  over  into  the  epoch  of imperialism. Its full solution postponed to the next stage of human progress,  socialism.  The  question  has  remained  and  become  the most vulnerable area on the domestic front of U.S. capitalism, its </p>

<p class="calibre1">society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">234</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacks,  therefore, in the struggle for national liberation and the entire working class  in its struggle for socialism are natural allies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  forging  of  this  alliance  is  enhanced  by  the  presence  of  a growing Black  industrial  working class  with direct and historical connections  with  white  labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  new  line  established  that  the  Black  freedom  struggle  is  a revolutionary movement in its own right, directed against the very foundations  of U  S.  imperialism,  with  its own dynamic pace and momentum,  resulting  from  the  unfinished  democratic  and  land revolutions in the South.  It places the Black liberation movement and  the class  struggle of U.S.  workers in their proper relationship as  two  aspects  of  the  fight  against  the  common  enemy—U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalism.  It  elevates  the  Black  movement  to  a  position  of equality  in  that  battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  theory  destroys  forever  the  white  racist  theory traditional  among  class-conscious  white  workers  which  had relegated  the  struggle  of  Blacks  to  a  subsidiary  position  in  the revolutionary  movement.  Race  is  defined  as a device of national oppression,  a smokescreen  thrown  up  by the class enemy, to hide the  underlying economic and social conditions  involved  in  Black oppression  and  to  maintain  the division  of the  working class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new theory was to  sensitize the  Party to  the revolutionary significance  of the  Black  liberation  struggle.  During the crisis  of the  thirties,  a  significant  segment  of  radicalized  white  workers would  come  to  see  the  Blacks  as  revolutionary  allies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The struggle for this position had now begun; there remained its adoption  by  the  Comintern  and  its  final  acceptance  by the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party.  Our  draft  resolution,  which summed  up these points,  was turned  over  to  Petrovsky  (Bennett),  Chairman  of  the  Anglo-American Secretariat.  He seemed quite pleased with it, expressed his  agreement  and  suggested  some minor changes.  He agreed  to submit  it  to  the  Negro  Commission  at  the  forthcoming  Sixth Congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  continued  to  work  with  Nasanov  on  preparations  for  the congress.  By  that  time,  we  had  become  quite  a  team.  Our  next project  was the South African question, a question which also fell under the jurisdiction  of the Anglo-American  Secretariat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a><img src="index-243_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">235</p>
<p class="calibre1">We  were  assigned  to  work  with  James  La  Guma,  a  South African Colored comrade  who had cometo Moscowto attend the Tenth  Anniversary celebrations and stayed on to discuss with the ECCI  and  the  Anglo-American  Secretariat  the  problems  of the South  African  Party.  Specifically,  we  were  to  draft  a  new resolution  on the question, restating and elaborating the Comintern line of an independent Native South  African  Republic.  (The word  “Native”  was  in  common  usage  at  the  time  of the  Sixth Congress,  though today it  is considered  derogatory and  has been replaced  with  Black  republic  or  Azania.) SOUTH  AFRICA</p>
<p class="calibre1">This line, formulated the year before with the cooperation of La Guma  during his  first  visit  to  the  Soviet  Union  in the spring of 1927,  had  been  rejected  by  the  leadership  of  the  South  African Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">La  Guma,  as  I  recall,  was  a  young  brown-skinned  man  of Malagasy and French parentage.  In South Africa, this placed him in  the  Colored  category,  a  rung  above  the Natives  on  the racial ladder  established  by  the  white  supremacist  rulers.  Colored persons  were  defined  as  those  of mixed  blood,  including descendants of Javanese slaves, mixed in varying degrees with European whites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">La Guma,  however, identified completely with the Natives and their  movement.  He  had  been  general  secretary  of  the  ICU </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Industrial and Commercial  Union, the federation of Native trade unions)  and  also  secretary  of the  Capetown branch of the ANC. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later, after his expulsion from the ICU by the red-baiting clique of Clements  Kadalie (a  Native  social  democrat),  La  Guma  became secretary  o f the  non-European  trade  union  federation  in  Capetown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">La Guma was the first South African communist I had ever met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was  delighted  and  impressed  with  him  and  was  to  find,  in the course  of  our  brief  collaboration,  striking  parallels  between the struggles of IJ.S.  Blacks for equality and those of the Native South</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Africans.  In both countries, the white leadership of their respective parties  underestimated  the  revolutionary  potential  of  the  Black movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">La Guma had made his first trip to Moscow the year before. He and Josiah Gumede, president of the ANC, had come as delegates to  the  inaugural  conference  of  the  League  Against  Imperialism which  had  convened  in  Brussels,  Belgium,  in  February  1927. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gumcdc attended as a delegate from the ANC, while La Guma was a  delegate  from  the  South  African  Communist  Party.  It  was La  Guma’s  first  international  gathering,  and  he  had  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  leaders  from  colonial  and  semi-colonial countries  and  discuss  the  South  African  question  with  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madame  Sun  Yat-scn  and  Pandit  Nehru  were  among  those present.  The  conference  adopted  the  resolutions  of  the  South African  delegates  on  the right  of self-determination  through  the complete overthrow of imperialism. The general resolutions of the congress  proclaimed:  “Africa  for  the  Africans,  and  their  full freedom  and  equality  with  other  races  and  the  right  to  govern Africa.”18</p>
<p class="calibre1">After Brussels,  La  Guma went  on a speaking tour to Germany, after which he came to Moscow. Although the Brussels conference had  called  for  the  right  of self-determination,  it  left  unanswered many  specific  questions  that  are  raised  by  that  slogan.  Were the Natives  in  South  Africa  a  nation? What  was to  be done with the whites? </p>
<p class="calibre1">La Guma was to find the answer to these questions in Moscow, where  he consulted  with  ECCI  leaders,  including Bukharin, who, was then  president  of the Comintern.  He participated with ECCI leaders  in  the  formulation  of a  resolution  on  the  South  African question,  calling  for  the  return  of the land  to the  natives and for </p>
<p class="calibre1">“an independent native South African republic as a stage towards a  workers’  and  peasants’  republic  with  full,  equal  rights  for all  races.” 19</p>
<p class="calibre1">La Guma returned  to South  Africa  with the resolution in June 1927;  Gumede  also  arrived  home  in  the  same  month.  But  the resolution  was  received  hostilcly  by Bunting and was rejected  by the  South  African  Party  leadership  at  its  annual  conference  in</p>

<p class="calibre1">SELF-DETERMINATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">237</p>
<p class="calibre1">December  1927. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bunting  was  a  British  lawyer  who  had  come to  South  Africa some years before.  An early South African socialist and a founder of  the  Communist  Party,  he  was  the  son  of a  British  peer.  As Bunting later commented,  he nearly used  up the small fortune he had  inherited  in  the  support  of Party  work  and  publications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bunting  and  his  followers  insisted  that  the  South  African revolution,  unlike  those  in  the colonies, was a direct struggle for socialism  without  any  intermediary  stages.  To  the  Comintern slogan  of a  “Native  South  African  Republic/’  Bunting counterposed  the  slogan  of a  “Workers’  and  Peasants’  Republic.” This concept  of “pure proletarian  revolution” was an echo of what we had found in the U.S.  Party with respect to  Blacks.  But  here, the error stood out grotesquely  given the reality of the South African situation  with  its  overwhelming Native  majority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was against this  background  that  La Guma and Gumede left to  go  to  Moscow  to  attend  the Tenth  Anniversary  celebrations, and  the  Congress  of the  Friends  of the Soviet  Union.  La  Guma apparently was  not in Moscow on that occasion; he was probably out  on  a  tour  of  the  provinces.  Both  he  and  Gumede  travelled widely  during  their  visit  to  the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our purpose at this time was to develop and clarify the line laid down  in  the  resolution  formulated  the previous  year.  Our  draft, with  few  changes,  was  adopted  by  the  Sixth  Congress  of  the Comintern  and  the  ECCI. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  already  noted,  Bunting  had  put  forward  the  slogan  of a South  African  “Workers’ and  Peasants’ Government.”  Bunting’s formulation  denied  the  colonial  character  of  South  Africa.  He failed,  therefore,  to  see  the  inherent  revolutionary  nature of the Natives’  struggle  for  emancipation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  opposed  to  this,  our  resolution  began  with  a definition  of South  Africa  as  “a  British dominion of the colonial type” whose colonial  features  included:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  country  was  exploited  by  British  imperialism,  with the  participation  of the South  African white bourgeoisie (British and  Boer), with British capital  occupying the principal economic position. </p>

<p class="calibre1">238</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  The  overwhelming majority of the population  were Natives and Colored (five million Natives and Colored, with one and a half million  whites,  according  to  the  1921  Census). </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  Natives,  who  held  only  one-eighth  of the land, were almost completely  landless,  the  great  bulk  of  their  land  having  been expropriated  by  the  white  minority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4. The “great difference in wages and material conditions of the white and black proletariat,” and the widespread corruption of the white  workers  by  the  racist  propaganda  and  ideology  of  the imperialists.20</p>
<p class="calibre1">These features,  we  held,  determined  the character of the South African  revolution  which,  in its first  stage, would  be a struggle of Natives and non-European peoples for independence and land. As the  previous resolution  had done, our draft (in the form  adopted by the Sixth Congress and the ECCI) held that as a result of these conditions,  in  order  to  lead  and  influence  that  movement, communists—black  and  white—must  put  forth  and  fight for the general  political slogan  of “an  independent  Native South African Republic  as  a  stage  towards  a  workers’  and  peasants’  republic, with  full,  equal  rights  for  all  races,  black,  coloured  and  white.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“South Africa is a black country.” the resolution went on to say, with  a  mainly  black  peasant  population,  whose  land  had  been expropriated  by  the  white  colonizers.  Therefore,  the  agrarian question  lies  at  the  foundation  of  the  revolution.  The  black peasantry, in alliance with a nd under the leadership of the working class,  is  the  main  driving  force.  Thus,  along with the slogan  of a </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Native  Republic,”  the Party must place the slogan “return of the land  to  the  Natives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  latter  formulation  does  not  appear  in  the  resolution  as finally  adopted.  Instead,  it  includes  the  following  two  formulations: 1.  Whites  must accept the “correct  principle that South Africa belongs  to  the  native  population.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  “The basic question in the agrarian situation in South Africa is  the  land  hunger  of the  blacks  and  .  .  .  their interest is of prior importance  in  the  solution  of the  agrarian  question.”21</p>
<p class="calibre1">With the new resolution completed, La Guma returned to South</p>

<p class="calibre1">Africa.  In the year since the first resolution, the opposition to the line  had  intensified  and  had  already  come  to  a  head  at  the December  Party  Congress—even  before  La  Guma's  return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bunting put forward his position in a fourteen page document in the  early  part  of  1928.  He  equated  the  nationalism  of the  Boer minority  to  the  nationalism  of  the  Natives  and  justified  his opposition to nationalism on the basis that all national movements were  subject  to  capitalist  corruption,  and,  in  the  case  of  South Africa,  a  national  movement  among  Natives  “would  probably only  accelerate  the  fusion,  in  opposition  to  it,  of the  Dutch  and British  imperialists.”22  Since  it  would  thus  only  consolidate  the forces  against  it,  it  was  not  to  be supported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bunting  not  only  underrated  nationalism,  he  played  on  the whites' fear of it  and  raised the specter of blacks being given free reign, with a resulting campaign to drive the whites into the sea.  He was echoing thespecter that was haunting whites who remembered the  song of the  Xhosas:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">To  chase  the  white  men from   the earth</i> <i class="calibre4">A nd drive  them  to  the sea. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The sea  that  cast  them  up at first</i> <i class="calibre4">For Am a Xhosas  curse  and bane</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Howls fo r  the progeny she nursed</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">To swallow  them  again</i>.23</p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  Bunting,  the  elimination  of whites  seemed to  be implied  in  the  slogan  of a  “Native  Republic.”  He  regarded  the phrase  “safeguards for minorities ” as having little meaning, since whites wrould assume that the existing injustices would be reversed; that,  in  effect,  blacks  would  do  to  them  what  they  had  been handing  out  for so  long</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Bunting had held that all nationalism was reactionary, La Guma distinguished between the revolutionary nationalism of the Natives  and  the “nationalism”  of the Boers (which  in reality was simply  a  quarrel  between sections of the ruling class),  He argued that  the  communists  must  not  hold  back  on  the  revolutionary demands  of the Natives in order to  pacify  the white workers who are still “saturated  with an imperialist ideology” and conscious of</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  privileges  they  enjoy  at  the  Natives’  expense.24</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bunting held that the road to socialism would be traveled under white  leadership;  to  La  Guma,  the  securing  of black  rights  was the  first  step  to  be  taken.  As  the  Simonses  described  it,  ‘‘First establish  African  majority  rule,  he argued,  and  unity,  leading to socialism,  would  follow.”  La  Guma  called  on  communists  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">“build up a mass party based upon the non-European masses,” put forward  the  slogan  of  a  Native  Republic  and  thus  destroy  the traditional  subservience  to  whites  among  Africans.25  This  argument  continued  up  through  the  Sixth  Congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MY  STAY IN  THE  CAUCASUS</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  middle  of  April  1928,  1  left  Moscow  for  a  stay  in  the Caucasus.  The  winter  had  been  one  of  those  long,  cold,  dark Moscow winters,  Snow was still  on the ground in April.  Over the whole season,  I  had been plagued  by recurrent seizures of grippe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between the demands of school and the preparations for the Sixth Congress,  it  had  been  a winter  of intense activity.  Undoubtedly, this had contributed to my inability to shake off the illness.  By the spring,  I  was  pretty  run  down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The school doctor detected a slight anemia and recommended a month  in  a  rest  home.  So,  I  was  shipped  off  to  Kislovodsk,  a famous  health  resort  in  the northern  Caucasus.  I  traveled  south and  east,  across  the  Ukrainian  steppe,  where  spring had already come to  Rostov-on-Don, the administrative center for the northern  Caucasus  region.  Then  on  to  Mincralny  Vody  (Mineral Water),  the  gateway  to  the  Caucasus  and  a  major  railroad junction.  I changed  there for  Kislovodsk, a short distance further towards  the  mountains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping  off  the  train  in  Kislovodsk  in  early  morning,  I  felt better at my first breath of fresh mountain air. The city was located in the  foothills on the northern range of the Caucasus.  Its mineral springs  were  famed  for their  medicinal  properties,  especially  for coronary  patients.  Formerly  a  famous  watering-place  for  the wealthy,  it was  now enjoyed  by all the Soviet  people.  Kislovodsk</p>

<p class="calibre1">was the source of the famous Narzan water which cost forty or fifty kopeks  a  bottle  in  Moscow.  Here  it  bubbled from  the ground  in numerous  springs,  and  you  could  drink  all  you  wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Checking in at  the sanitarium.  I  was assigned to a room shared by three others—two workers and a Party functionary from Tbilisi named  Kolya  Tsereteli.  Kolya  was  a  tall,  handsome,  swarthy young man.  He cut quite a  figure in his long Georgian  <i class="calibre4">robochka,</i> soft  leather  boots,  high  astrakhan  cap  and  ornamental  belt, complete with   <i class="calibre4">kinjal</i> (dagger).  He immediately took me in charge and  became  my  constant  companion during  my  stay  there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  I  had  been  examined  by  a  doctor  who  prescribed  daily baths,  Kolya took me around on  a sightseeing tour.  The  sun  was coming  up  over  the  parks,  cypress  trees  and  places  for  open  air concerts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After several weeks,  I  felt  much  better and was soon chafing at the bit, bored with the regimen and eager to return to Moscow. At this  point  Kolya  suggested  that  we  might  try  to  arrange  my accompanying him to his home in Tbilisi (hot springs) and stay for a week  before  returning to  Moscow.  I  was delighted and  had no difficulty  in  getting  both  my  release  from  the  sanitarium  and permission  from  the  school  to  make the  trip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tbilisi—the Florence of the Caucasus—was a beautiful modern city, stretching for miles along both sides of the Kura River. It had spacious  avenues  lined  by  stately  cypress  trees;  handsome  buildings  and  apartments;  a  magnificent  cathedral,  its  great  central dome flanked by four cupolas, framed against a background of the mountains  of  the  mighty  Caucasus  chain,  with  Mount  David rising 2,500 feet  above the  city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  mixed  population  of  mainly  Georgians,  Armenians, Jews and someTurko-Tartars.  Kolya explained that there actually were more Armenians than Georgians living there in the capital of Georgia!  He went on to tell me that in the Caucasus, ethnic groups often  overlapped their national  boundaries  as finally constituted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was particularly so in the case of the Armenians, who were the victims  of genocida!  persecution  and  dispersal  by  Turkey.  As  a result,  there were more Armenians  in  Azerbaidzhan and Georgia than  in  the  Armenian  Republic  itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a><img src="index-250_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">242</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the old days, Georgian nationalism was directed more against the  Armenians  than  against  the  Russians.  The  Armenians  had a larger  merchant  class.  They  dominated  commerce  and  were  an obstacle  to  the  growth  of  the  weak  Georgian  bourgeoisie  who retaliated  by whipping up national animosity against the Armenians.  Hence,  national  hatred  was  often  directed  against  rival national  groups rather than  against the dominant  Czarist  power, and the  Czarist  government  exploited  these  animosities  fully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  area  was  known  for  bloody  battles  between  the  various ethnic groups.  But all that ended  with the revolution, Kolya said, and  with  the  establishment  of  the  Trans-Caucasian  Federation, based  on  national  equality  and  voluntary  consent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  the federation,  which  was composed  of three republics (Georgia, Azerbaidzhan and Armenia), the Georgian republic had three  minority  districts:  Abkhazia  and  Azaria  as  autonomous republics,  and  Yugo-Osetia  as  an  autonomous  region.  National languages  and  cultures  were  flourishing  under  the  new  regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">uAs  you  will see,  here  in Tbilisi  we have Georgian,  Armenian and  Russian  theaters,”  Kolya  told  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kolya hailed an  <i class="calibre4">izvozchik</i> and we rode to his apartment, located on  one of the broad  tree-lined  avenues of the city.  Arriving there, we  were  happily  greeted  by  his  family,  His  wife,  an  attractive young schoolteacher, received me warmly and told  me that Kolya had written her about  me. They had two beautiful children, a boy of about three and  a girl about five.  They seemed  fascinated with my  appearance  and  couldn't  take  their  eyes  off  me.  I  was undoubtedly  the  first  Black  man  they  had  ever  seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  being told  by Kolya to “shake hands with the black uncle,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  boy  hesitantly  extended  his  little  hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took it and gently shook it.  When he withdrew it, he looked at his hand to see whether some of the black had come off and seemed rather  surprised  that  it  hadn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,  it  won’t  come  off,”  I  said,  and  we  all  laughed.  I  had experienced this reaction from Russian children in Moscow, and it never  failed  to  amuse  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Tseretelis lived in a clean and  neatly-furnished three-room apartment on the second floor of the building, with a balcony over</p>

<p class="calibre1">the sidewalk. As if reading my thoughts, Kolya said, “Don't worry, we all usually sleep in  one room;  the other is for  my brother who stays  here with us.  He is out of town, so you can stay in  his room'*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kolya  was  anxious  to  check  in  at  the  Party  office  where  he worked,  so  we left  our  baggage  and  walked  to  his  office a  short distance  away.  I  was  interested  in  the  people  we  passed.  They looked  better  dressed  than  the  Russians  back  in  Moscow,  their costumes  were  gayer.  Perhaps  it  was  due  to  the  milder  climate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kolya served  as  the  deputy  secretary  of the  Agitprop Department  of  the  Tbilisi  Committee  of  the  Communist  Party.  He introduced  me  to  his  fellow  workers  in  the  department;  they  all seemed glad to see him and remarked  how well he looked after his rest.  They were speaking Georgian; Kolya asked them to speak in Russian  in  deference  to  me.  They  all  seemed  to  be  multilingual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kolya,  I  knew,  besides  his  native  Georgian,  spoke  Russian, Armenian  and  some  French.  The  comrades  insisted  on  calling a conference.  Like most Party officials, they were well-informed on both domestic and  international  questions and  were an  educated audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  asked  me my impressions  of their country, and  they also had questions about  the situation  in the  United States,  about  the conditions  of Blacks.  Kolya told them that  I was a student  at the Lenin School in  Moscow and that formerly I had been at KUTVA. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  knew  about  KUTVA  as  they  too  had  sent  students  there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were interested in the work I had done in preparation for the forthcoming Sixth Congress,  and  they were familiar with Stalin’s report  to  the  Fifteenth  Party  Congress  from  that  December, where  he  described  the  international  situation.  They  asked  me questions about the international situation and the war danger and we  exchanged  opinions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kolya explained that I was only going to be in town for a couple of  days.  It  was  Friday  then,  and  I  was  scheduled  to  leave  on Sunday.  As I  remember, we took a car from  the pool and two or three people from the office accompanied us on a sightseeing tour along the  banks  of the river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We returned to Kolya's home where his wife had a delicious big meal  waiting for us:   <i class="calibre4">shashlik, </i>  fruits  and  pastries.  We sat up until</p>

<p class="calibre1">late that night telling stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  day  we saw a number of places of interest,  bathed  in the  famous  hot  sulfur springs,  went  up to  the  summit  of Mount David and saw the old church on the mountain, which dated back centuries,  and  the  mausoleum  of  famous  Georgian  poets  and patriots.  All  in  all  we  spent  a  very  enjoyable weekend  together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  Sunday,  Kolya and  his wife took me to the station and put me on  the train  for Moscow.  Three days later I was back home. I saw Kolya once again when he was on a visit to Moscow and I took him out to dinner. </p>
