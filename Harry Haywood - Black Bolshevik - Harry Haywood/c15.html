<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Organizing  the  Black  Belt</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  spring  of  1933,  Haywood  Patterson  of the  Scottsboro Boys  was  declared  guilty  by  a  court  in  Decatur,  Alabama. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  his  conviction,  a  wave  of  indignation  swept  Black communities  across  the  country.  Mass  protest  rallies,  demonstrations  of  all  sorts  and  parades  culminated  in  the  Free  the Scottsboro  Boys  March  on  Washington  on  May  7-9,  1933. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The right danger took concrete form  when the ILD leadership allowed  themselves  to  be  suckercd  into  an  agreement  with  the NAACP  leadership.  These  leaders  made  overtures  to  the  ILD, offering  to  help  raise  funds  for  the  mounting  legal  defense expenses  and  particularly  for  those  of the Patterson  appeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This offer, however, was made with conditions which amounted to giving the NAACP veto power over all expenditures of defense Funds,  and  thus over defense activities. It was a ploy which would allow NAACP leaders such as Joel Spingam and Walter White to regain  their position  in  the defense  campaign and  appear before the  masses  as  leaders in  this  campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  the  beginning  of  the  campaign  two  years  before,  the Spingam-White crowd had used every possible means to wrest the defense  from  the  ILD.  Their  efforts  were  in  vain,  but  they continued  to  attack—not  the  lynchers—but  the  defense.  For example, shortly after the Patterson verdict, the NAACP board of directors  stated  that  the  only  bope  for  the  boys  was to  "remove </p>
<p class="calibre1">...the  additional  burden  of communism.” 1</p>

<p class="calibre1">392</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  these  leaders,  largely discredited  and  isolated,  attempted to get hack into the defense. The sharp rise in the movement under the leadership  of the  ILD,  which followed the Patterson  verdict, forced  them  to  make  a  tactical  retreat.  Realizing  they  had misjudged the temper of the masses they now attempted to regain a place within the defense in order to more effectively sabotage it. To this  end  they  made  overtures  to  the  ILD,  offering  to  help  raise funds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an  ILD staff meeting which I attended as head of the Party’s Negro Department, the NA ACP offer was discussed favorably by most  of the  staff.  George  Maurer,  who  played  a  leading role  in organizing the Scottshoro defense,  and myself were the only ones to object.  William Patterson,  national secretary, argued that there was  no  alternative  if the  organization  were  to  gain  the  financial support  we  needed  for  the  Haywood  Patterson  appeal  and  the future trials of the other boys.2 As I recall, our objections were to no avail  and  the  agreement  was  carried  through.3</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  deal  was  obviously  set  up  by  £amuel  Leihowitz,  one  of America’s  leading  criminal  lawyers,  who  had  become  quite  well known  for  his  defense  of certain  gangster  types.  He  had  volunteered  his  services free of charge to the ILD and was accepted  as the chief defense lawyer in the trial of Haywood Patterson. He won national  acclaim  by  his  hrilliant  conduct  of  the  defense  and emerged  as  a  hero  of that trial.  On  his return to  New  York from Decatur, Alabama, more than 3,000 peopje poured out of Harlem to  greet  him  at  Pennsylvania  Station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leihowitz  was  a  man  of  great  personal  amhition.  (He  later became a justice of the New York Supreme Court.) He was clearly uncomfortable  in  the  company  of revolutionaries  and  sought  to avoid  too close identification  with the ILD,  He brought the ILD </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  NAACP  together,  ostensibly  to  achieve  unity,  hut  in reality to weaken the hold of the ILD on the defense and pave the way  for  an  eventual  takeover  by  the  NAACP  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ILD went  on  to compound this original mistake. They not only  accepted  the  deal  hut  hailed  the  NAACP  leaders  for  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">“changed  attitude.”  In fact,  the agreement  reflected no change of heart  hy NAACP  leaders. They continued to draw a line hetween</p>

<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">393</p>
<p class="calibre1">defense  in  the  courts  and  the  mass  movement.  They  tried  to confine their support to the courts and moved to sabotage the mass defense  movement,  both  from  within  and  from  without.  They refused  to  support  the  Free  the  Scottshoro  Boys  March  on Washington, hut this proved to be a serious hlunder for the already crisis-ridden  and  isolated  NAACP. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly before the march on Washington, our right opportunist mistakes  were  continued  in  the Scottshoro Action Committee,  a broad united front which was under the leadership of the ILD. The NAACP had  hecome largely discredited and “left” reformists like William H. (Kid) Davis, puhlisher of the  <i class="calibre4">Amsterdam Mews, </i> tried to step  into  the  vacuum.  Davis,  along  with  Black  politicians  who served  as fronts  for New  York’s Tammany  Hall,  attempted to set lip  a  new  so-called  non-partisan  defense  committee  for  the purpose  of the  march.  This  was  part  of their  effort  to  seize  the leadership  of the  growing  mass  movement  that  was  catling for a march  on  Washington.  Davis attempted to divert  it from a mass march  into  a  committee  of  representative  citizens  who  would present  a  petition  to  the  president. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the beginning of this move, the Scottshoro Action Committee tailed after the reformists. They failed at first to see through the left rhetoric of the group’s criticisms of the NAACP,  But within a short  time,  we  corrected  this  mistake and  regained leadership of ihe movement. We did the actual organization and formulation of the  proposals  for  the  march,  which  went  over  successfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 participated  in the organization  of the march on Washington along  with  Patterson,  Ford  and  others—helping  to  prepare  the program  and  working out  technical  details.  The  march involved people mainly from the cities  of the eastern seabord; there hadn’t been time to organize a truly national demonstration. The demand of the march was “Freedom for the  Scottshoro Boys,” which was lied  in  with  demands  in  the  area  of  civil  rights:  an  end  to discrimination  in  voting,  jury  service,  schools,  housing,  public accommodations,  trade  unions  and  the  death  penalty  for lynching,4</p>
<p class="calibre1">These  demands  were  summed  up  in  the  Bill  of  Rights  put forward  hy  the  LSNR.  The  3,000  marchers,  led  by  Ruhy  Bates, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p416"></a><img src="index-416_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Jane Patterson (mother of Haywood Patterson) and William Patterson  of  the  ILD,  demanded  to  meet  with President </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roosevelt.5  Roosevelt  was  in  conference  with  Dr.  Hajalmar Schacht,  the  special  German  envoy,  and  refused  to  meet  the marchers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We did visit various congressmen who all said it was a matter for the  courts,  they  could  do  nothing.  Oscar  DcPriest,  a  Black congressman from the Thompson machine in Chicago, showed his true  colors  declaring that  we  weren’t  going to get him  into this mess!  We  left  the  petitions  with  Louis  Howe,  the  president’s secretary;  saw  Vice-President  Garner  and  the  Speaker  of  the House.  We  then  paraded  through the streets  of Washington and headed  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  march,  the  Politburo  of  the  Party  reviewed  the Scottsboro  campaign  since  the  Patterson  verdict.  The  right mistakes before the march arose from a basic misconception of the united  front.  Behind  this  was  the  idea  that  a  united  front  meant unity with everybody,  under any conditions.  Involved here was a definite  underestimation  of  the  class  role  of the  Black  reformist leaders  as  agents  of  the  ruling  class  in  the  ranks  of  the  Afro-American  people.  Their  influence  could only  be destroyed  in  the course  of building a  united  front  with the masses from  below. It was the same as the situation in the labor movement with regard to the labor  bureaucracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We decided that a resolution should be developed in the light of our  discussions;  the  Negro  Department  was  given  the  task  of drafting  such  a  resolution.  We  summed  up  these  mistakes  in  a resolution  which  was  adopted  by  the  Politburo.  In  its  criticism of the ILD’s deal with the NA ACP,  the resolution stated that the 1LD  should  have  offered  the  NAACP  a  “straight  forward  and clear  proposal  of mass  struggle  and  mobilization  of the  masses against  the  capitalist  frame-up  courts  and  Jim-Crow  legal  system,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the NAACP had accepted this program, it would have clearly discredited  their past policy of relying on the courts.  “If they had refused such an offer, this also would have cleared the issues before the eyes  of the  masses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p417"></a><img src="index-417_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">395</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resolution  went  on  further  to  state: In  such  a  broad  mass  struggle  as  that  of  the  Scottsboro conscious agents of the ruling bourgeoisie endeavor to come into  the  united  front for the purpose of smashing the mass movement and thus serving the bourgeoisie....It is necessary... </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  warn  the  masses  constantly  of  the  class  role  of  these elements....Under all conditions it is necessary to maintain the independent role of the Party and of the revolutionary forces in such a united front both in regard to our agitation and our actions.6</p>
<p class="calibre1">SOUTHERN  TOUR</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our line,  projecting  the  question  of U.S.  Blacks  as essentially that  of  an  oppressed  nation,  called  for  making  the  South  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“center  of gravity"  for work  among them.  Though  I  had spent  a brief  period  in  North  Carolina,  it  was  not  the  deep  Black  Belt South, the focus of the Party’s concentration.  I was eager to visit the area, to see how our theory regarding the national question and the  role  of  the  “Black  peasantry"  were  being  worked  out  in practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The opportunity came in the early part of 1933. In consultation with the Alabama district organizer, Nat Ross; Elizabeth Lawson, acting editor of the  <i class="calibre4">Southern  Worker</i> (the Party’s Southern newspaper); and A1 Murphy, secretary of the Sharecroppers Union (all of whom  were  in  New  York  at  the  time),  it  was  decided  that  I should  spend  several  weeks  in  the  Alabama district. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving in Birmingham, I had no difficulty in finding the hotel where the comrades had arranged for me to stop. It was on Fourth Avenue,  downtown  in  a  small  Black  business  area,  near  the <i class="calibre4">Birmingham  World</i>,  the  city’s  Black  weekly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I registered, the owner and desk clerk said, “Oh, yes, Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haywood.  We’ve  been  expecting  you.  Your  friends  will  be here shortly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  shown  to  my  room  and  a few  minutes later two  young Black  comrades,  Hosea  Hudson  and  Joe  Howard,  came  to  my</p>

<p class="calibre1">396</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">room.  Both  were  unemployed  steel  workers.  They  had  been assigned  as  my  liaisons  to  the local  Party  organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Birmingham, the South’s greatest industrial center, the ruling white supremacist oligarchy expressed the interest of local capitalist  Black  Belt  planters  of the  adjacent  counties,  local  representatives  of  northern  based  industrial  and  financial  corporations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of these  latter merged socially with their Southern counterparts. At the top of the corporate list was the gigantic United States Steel Corporation, sprawling over a section of the town itself. The Gentlemen’s  Agreement  of  1877  remained  in  full  force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  principle  enunciated  by  Judge  Taney  in  the  Dred  Scott decision that the Black has no rights that the white man is bound to respect  was  still  fully  operative.  Jim  Crow  laws  in  public  places were  strictly  enforced.  The  purpose  of  it  all  was  to  preserve  a cheap,  subservient,  divided  and  unorganized  labor  force  of degraded, disenfranchised Blacks and poverty-ridden whites. The latter  were  psychologically  compensated  by  being  accepted  as members  of a  superior  race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Birmingham, racism was all-pervasive and blatant. One could feel  it  in  the  atmosphere.  Birmingham was a  mean town,  a place where  the  police  periodically  shot  down  Black  people  to  “keep them in  line,”  the  latter  being  mostly young  and  unemployed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  we  walked  down  the  street,  Hosea  and Joe told  me, “If you expect to  work down here,  you gotta look  like the rest of us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You gotta cut out that fast walking with your head up in the air— </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  these  crackers’ll spot  you.  Get that slouch in your  walk.  Look scared, as if you are about to run,” he joked. These were big tough men talking now. Of course they were kidding—still, there was a grain  of truth in  these  remarks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  a  new  element  had  entered  the  picture—the  Communist Party.  Formed in  1930 by  organizers from the north, the Party in Birmingham took the first steps towards building a union of steel workers,  laying  the  groundwork  for  building  the  CIO  Steel Workers  Union  in  1935.  It  had  initiated  a  movement  of unemployed  which  organized  a demonstration  of 7,000  people  on  the steps  of the  Jefferson  County  Courthouse  in  November  1932.7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Though  the  numbers  were  not  large,  the  Party  grew  rapidly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p419"></a><img src="index-419_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">397</p>
<p class="calibre1">during the 1932 election campaign. Three hundred Blacks and fifty whites  gathered  to  greet  William  Z.  Foster  at  an  election  rally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poster, however, failed to appear because of illness. The following week,  400  Blacks  and  300  whites  attended  a  meeting  to  hear Hathaway;  this  meeting  was  broken  up  by  vigilantes  throwing stink  bombs  from  galleries.  There  were  also  a  number  of mass meetings  called  on  the  Scottsboro  issue,  including  one  of 3,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  at  the  Black  Masonic Temple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party  had  chosen  Birmingham as  the  center  for  its drive into  the  deep  South  and  as  the  logical  jump-off  place  for  the development  of a  movement among the small  Black farm  operators. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  most  dramatic  struggle  was  the  movement  of  tenants, sharecroppers  and farm laborers centered  in Tallapoosa  County, southeast  of  Birmingham.  The  area  bordered  on  the  Black  Belt plantation  region  and  resembled  the  latter  in  respect  to  farm values, types of tenancy and  racial composition. The first local of the Sharecroppers  Union  was  organized  there  in  1931.  That was before  the  Federal  Relief  Crop  Reduction  Program  had  been instituted.  The small owners, tenants, croppers and farm laborers were  hit  the  hardest  by  the  crisis.  Merchants  and  bankers  had refused to “furnish” or provide them credit.  Mortgages left them at the mercy of their creditors. Small operators lived under constant threat  of foreclosure and eviction. The wages for farm laborers ran us  low  as  fifty  cents  a  day  for  men  and  twenty-five  cents  for women.8</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  close  proximity  to  the  Party organization  in  Birmingham facilitated  the  organization  of these poor  farmers  in  the  area.  A number of them had worked in mines north of Birmingham and in steel  plants and factories  in  the city itself, returning to the land to eke  out  a  living during the  Depression.  There  was  a  continuous movement  to  and  from  the  city,  and  those  who didn’t  make the move  themselves  had  close  relatives  who  did  so.  Thus  the development of the sharecroppers’ struggle in Alabama, in contrast to  other regions  of the  Black  Belt  where  oppression was equally intense (for example, South Carolina or Mississippi), took a more organized  and consciously  revolutionary form.  This accounts for</p>

<p class="calibre1">398</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  struck  me  as  the  relatively  high  political  development  of union  members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Local  farmers  sent  a  letter to the  <i class="calibre4">Southern  Worker</i> in Chattanooga, asking that organizers he sent  to belp them build a union The Party responded and sent  several  people, among them Mack Coad,  a  Black steelworker.  Coad,  arriving at the scene,  met with the  Gray  brothers—Ralph  and  Tom—and  other local  leaders.  It was  deeided that a meeting should be called for July  16, at Mary's Church  near  Camp  Hill,  to  protest  tbe  Scottsboro  convictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Included  in  the  agenda  of  the  meeting  would  be  plans  for organizing a union around the minimum demands of the tenants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most immediate aim was to force the landlords to increase the quantity  of  “furnishings”  through  the  winter,  and  douhle  the wages  of  the  plantation  laborers.  A  last  minute  arrangement eommittee  of the  leaders  met  the  night  before,  on  July  15. </p>
<p class="calibre1">-  The  county  sheriff and  local  gentry  were aware  of the defiant moods among the sharecroppers.  The sheriff had  been  tipped off by a local stoolpigeon that an outside agitator was in the area and that  radical  meeting?  were  being  held.  The  same  stoolpigeon informed them about the meeting of leaders on July 15. He and his deputies,  seeking  the “outsider,” raided the meeting  They found that they were all from Tallapoosa County, and they convinced the sheriff that the  meeting was just a  harmless get-together and that they knew nothing about  an  outside  organizer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next night, July  16, the sheriff and his deputies approached the meeting, where they were confronted by Ralph Gray, wbo had been posted as a picket. Shots were exchanged in which both Gray and  the  sheriff  were  wounded.  The  sheriff and  his  deputies  fled hack  to  town,  where  a  posse  was  formed  amidst  cries  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“communist-instigated  Negro  rebellion,”  and  a  manhunt  began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the ensuing battle,  five  Blacks were wounded in addition to Ralph Gray. A Black cropper helped carry him to his home, where Coad  and  several  other  armed  Blacks  had  gathered.  The  posse approached Gray’s  home and a battle ensued. The croppers, faced with  overwhelming  odds,  decided  to  disperse.  Gray,  however, refused  to  be removed  to safety  and  insisted  upon “dying in his own home.” The croppers insisted that Coad must flee and helped</p>

<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">399</p>
<p class="calibre1">him to escape to Atlanta. Gray’s home was riddled with bullets by l he  posse  and  when  they  broke in,  he  was  found  dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition  to  the  wounded,  thirty  more  Blacks  were  finally rounded  up  and  arrested  in  the  manhunt  that  followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hrutal  repression  following  Camp  Hill  did  not crush  the movement;  the  union  regrouped  underground  and  continued  to grow.  By spring  1932,  the union elaimed  500 members, mainly in Tallapoosa  and  Chambers  Counties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  December  1932,  there  were  shoot-outs  in  Reeltown  in Tallapoosa  County  involving  Cliff James,  a  union  leader  in the area. The sheriff had tried to serve a writ of attachment on James’s livestock as a result of his landlord’s refusing him an extension on a year’s  rent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sharecroppers  elected a committee to meet the sheriff and when  the  latter  arrived  to  seize  the  property,  he  found  union members  armed  and  barricaded  in  the  house.  In  tbe  ensuing battles,  the  sheriff and  two  deputies  were  wounded,  one  sharecropper  killed  and  several  wounded,  including James  and  Milo Bentley.  The sharecroppers  scattered  through  the  woods.  James and  Bentley  made  it  to  Tuskegee  Institute,  where  according  to several  accounts,  a  Black doctor turned  them over to the sheriff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were then  taken to  Kilby Prison where both  men with their wounds  untreated  were  forced  to  sleep  on  the  cold  floor;  both subsequently  died  from exposure.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  shoot-out  was  followed  by  mob  action  and  violence exceeding that  of the previous year after the Camp  Hill affair.  A posse  of more  than  500  men  went  on  a  manhunt for Black farm operators  and  “communist  agitators.”  Mobs  raided  homes  of union  members;  several  were  reported  to  have  been  killed  or beaten.  Many union members fled to the woods for safety and the number of  Blacks  killed  in  the  four-day  rioting was  not  known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  told  that  some white farmers  had  hidden  Blacks in their homes during the rampages of the sheriffs mobs. At the time, I was (old  by someone that the racists had trouble getting enough  men lor their  posses  from  Tallapoosa  County  and  had  to  go  outside (he county  to  recruit  vigilantes.10</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bodies of the two men were laid out in Birmingham, draped</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  broad  red  rihhons  decorated  by  the  hammer  and  sickle.  The <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> reported:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Day  and  night,  a  guard  of honor,  composed  of Negro and white workers, stood at attention by the coffins. The funeral home  was  filled  with  flowers  and  wreaths....Thousands  of workers filed past  the coffins to pay tribute to the martyred leaders  of the sharecroppers.11</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some 3,000 people attended the funeral,  150 of whom were whites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again terror failed to suppress the union.  Despite the arrest of some  of  its  most  active  members,  union  members  and  sympathizers poured into  Dadeville (the county seat) before dawn on the day of the trial of those arrested. The courtroom was filled and the crowd  overflowed  into the  square.  On  the  second  day of the trial,  roadblocks  were put up and  whites filled the courthouse to prevent  Blacks  from  attending.  Nevertheless,  Blacks  came along the  by-passes  and  across  streams,  demanding  to  he  seated.  The judge was put on the spot and requested the whites to clear half the courtroom.  The trial resulted in the sentencing and  conviction of those  accused.12</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  union  nevertheless  continued  to  grow  and  by  1933  had 3,000  members,  including  a  few  whites.  Its  membership  and influence  was extending to neighboring counties.  The shoot-outs at  Camp  Hill  and  Reeltown  brought  into  focus  the  explosive character of the struggle of the region’s Black soil tillers. It revealed that  the fight for even the smallest demands by the sharecroppers and tenants could lead to armed conflict. In fact, any demand that would  give  Blacks  a  voice in  renting and determining wages was regarded  as  insurrectionary  by  the  local  gentry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was this explosive feature which distinguished the movement of Black soil  tillers from that of the white farmers in the rest of the country or even the  South  itself.  The demands of the Blacks were more  revolutionary  than those of the whites for they represented the  demands  of  the  agrarian  and  democratic  revolutions,  left unfinished  by  the  betrayal  of  Reconstruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following all this in New York, I was eager to visit Alabama and the  sharecroppers.  1  was  curious  to  know  how  the  union  had grown  in  the  face  of all  that  terror,  Wbat  were  the  methods  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">organization they used? A1 Murphy told me to go down to the area ilKClf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy  was  a  tall, jet-hucd  Black,  an cx-steelworker and  the most important  organizer of the sharecroppers.  Soft-spoken and modest to the point of self-effacement, he had given me a rundown on  the  Sharecroppers  Union,  playing  down  his  own  role  and disclaiming  credit  for  its  achievements.  Murphy  was  a  self-rducated  Marxist,  a  genuine  worker-intellectual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  praised  the  local  leaders  and  their  high  level  of political development.  He said the people built the organization from their own  experience  and  that  the croppers  had  a  tradition  of underground  organization.  Any  people who had experienced that kind of oppression,  he  said,  would  have  done  the  same  thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Discussing  the  matter  with  local  comrades  in  Birmingham,  it was  agreed  that  I  should  go  to  Tallapoosa  County,  but I had to wait  for  them  to  arrange  security.  The  opportunity  came  when I cm  Harris  and  Hal  Ware,  leaders  of the  Party’s  national  farm work,  passed  through  Birmingham  on  their  way  to an executive hoard  meeting of the Sharecroppers Union. They were heading for t )adeville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We left Birmingham at dusk, driving at night so as not to attract attention.  The  car  was  a  Chevrolet  coupe—the  two-door  model with a fold-down rumble seat in the back. 1 sat in the rumhle seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  we  got  to  Dadeville it  was dark.  Hal turned  to  me saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d  better  pull  down  the  top  of the  rumble seat  over you.”  I hastily complied  as we were in enemy territory and didn’t want to attract  attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We soon passed the lights of Dadeville. A short distance out, we came to a farmhouse and stopped. This was Tommy Gray’s place, lie  was  a  small  independent  farm  operator  and  like most  of his fellow  operators  in  the  area,  he  was  deeply  in  debt.  Greeted  by (iray  who  had  expected  us,  we  went into the house.  He had  met Hal  and  Lem  at  the  Farmers’  National  Relief  Conference  the year before.  He took our coats and put them in the bedroom wh ich looked  like a  small arsenal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  guns  of  all  kinds—shotguns,  rifles  and  pistols. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharecroppers  were  coming  to  the  meeting armed  and  left  their</p>

<p class="calibre1">guns with their coats when they came in. Everyone came and left at night;  the  meeting  lasted,  as  1  remember,  two days.  There  were fifteen  or twenty people there,  members of the executive board. I was  impressed  hy the  efficient  manner  in  which  Gray conducted the  meeting;  they  were an  impressive group  overall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was introduced as a member of the Party’s Central Committee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  recall,  1  spoke  about  the  international  situation  and  the Scottshoro  and  Herndon  cases.  Hal  and  Lem  said  a  few  words ahout the farmers’ movement in other parts of the country and the follow  up  of the  National  Farmers  Conference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  most  impressed  by  the  reports  of  the  leaders  of  locals ahout  their  areas.  They  described  conditions,  how  they  were preparing for a  strike,  and  gave  reports  on  different  landlords.  I was  also  impressed  that  they  could  spread  a  leaflet  over  four counties  inside  of fifteen minutes,  They had a tight  underground organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  learned  there  of an  attempt  to  assassinate  Tommy  Gray.  It seemed that Tommy was fishing at the creek, when he heard a shot and a bullet whizzed past his ear. He turned quickly and saw a man running  whom  he  recognized  as  Charles  Harris,  a  cropper  and union  memher.  The  union  had  set  up a  committee to investigate the  incident  and  they  brought  a  report  back  at  the  meeting  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">attended. One of the reporters told the group that they had visited the  accused  man  and  uncovered  other  information.  He  had evidently  been  hired  hy  somchody  from  the  town,  a  sheriff  or landlord,  to  kill  Tommy  Gray.  They  had  bribed  the  man  with  a promise  not  to call  his  loan  in  if he  would  do  their work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  discussion  followed  the report, as people wondered what to do with the turncoat.  Some argued  he should  he permanently got rid  of.  But  other,  cooler heads,  argued  that this would  only play right  into the hands of the sheriff.  He would use it as an excuse to come down  on the whole group. The sober point of view prevailed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was decided a committee would visit the man and tell him to get out of the area; if he didn’t, then they would deal with him. 1 heard later that this tactic was successful, and the man and his family left after the  delegation’s  visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I left  Dadeville in  high spirits, more than ever convinced of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">correctness  of our  line;  that  the  Black  Belt  peasantry  under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party was the motor  of  Black  rebellion  in  the  deep  South.  I  felt  that  the Sharecroppers  Union  was  definitely  a  prototype  for  the  future organization  of  the  Black,  landless,  debt-ridden  and  racially persecuted  farmers  of the area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  union continued to  grow after I left.  By the fall of  1935, it churned  12,000  memhers,  including  some  poor  whites;  2,500  of these were scattered in Louisiana,  Mississippi, Georgia and North Carolina.  In  1936  it  was  liquidated—a  victim  of  Browderism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  my  return  trip  to  the  national  office  in  New  York  from Birmingham, I decided to stop over in Atlanta for a few days. This would  be a chance for me to check on the Party’s activities in this important city and to see Ben  Davis, Jr.  Ben was the young Black attorney  who  had  courageously  and  dramatically defended  Angelo  Herndon in  the  famous  “insurrection”  case.  It  was this case which  brought  young  Davis  national  attention.  Along  with Scottshoro,  it  had become a symbol  of the fight for Black  rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  neared  Atlanta,  I  tried  to  recall  what  I  knew  of  Ben. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  we had  never met,  I had learned about  his background Irom  friends  who  were active  with  him  in the  Herndon  defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hen’s father was a self-made man from a poor Georgia family.  He lind worked his way into prominence and some wealth in Atlanta, mui was bigh in the councils of the Republican Party, once having nerved  as  a  national  committeeman.  An  old-style  Republican  in the tradition  of Frederick Douglass,  he was a determined fighter lor  civil  rights,  voting,  education  and  opportunity  for  Black business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  become  owner  and  puhlisher  of  the   <i class="calibre4">Atlanta  Independent. </i>  an  influential  Black newspaper.  He  was also the district grand  secretary  of the  Negro  Odd  Fellows,  the  largest  fraternal order  in  the  state.  From  this  position,  he  was  able to  huild  the Imposing  Odd  Fellows  business  hloek  on  Auhum  Avenue.  Ben Senior had  had ambitious plans for his only son.  He had sent bim lo  exclusive  New  England  schools—Amherst  and  Harvard  Law School.  But the  Depression  had  interrupted  these  plans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Depression had an especially devastating effect on the Black</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p426"></a><img src="index-426_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">404</p>

<p class="calibre1">community.  Not only were  poor  and  working class Blacks driven into deeper poverty* but the small and growing Black middle class, which was already on marginal foundations, was almost completely wiped out. Ben Davis* S r, became a victim of the Depression. He lost the newspaper and the husiness block passed into the hands of an  insurance  company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coupled  with  economic decline  was  the inauguration of Hoover's  “Southern  Strategy’* of replacing Black  Republicans with a lily-white  faction.  Ben  Senior  was  removed  from  his  post  as Republican  national committeeman, with a corresponding loss of his  powers  of patronage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Young  Davis  returned  from  his Ivy  League education  to  find this devastated situation.  A young Black attorney in the South was forced  to work in a very narrow field. It was unheard of for a Black to argue a case against a white attorney. This left Ben Junior with drafting  deeds,  wills,  contracts*  divorces  and  other  such  matters relating only to Blacks—a severely restricted arena for his Harvard Law  School  training,  Ben  hung  up  his  shingle  in  the  old Odd  Fellows  building,  and  soon  formed  a  partnership  with another  Black  attorney,  John  Geer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was soon dissatisfied and angry; however, as his frustration grew,  he found  himself “challenged  by the thought  of what could be  done  if one  put  up  a  really tough  fight  for  the  constitutional rights  of Negroes  in a  Georgia  court.*'13</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Herndon case provided Ben with just such an opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Effectively  employing  a  working  class  policy  in  the  trials,  Ben conducted  a militant and aggressive defense.  He appeared  before the  court  as  a  tribune  for  Blacks  and  poor  whites  against Georgia's  white  supremacist oligarchy. The trial  had been a high point  of class  militancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving in Atlanta by car on a Sunday morning, I went directly to the Davis home. Ben, his father and sister (his mother had died the  year before)  lived  in  a  large  house  on  Boulevard  off Auburn Avenue  in  a  Black  middle  class neighborhood.  The family’s past affluence  was  evident  by  the  five-car  garage  in  the  rear  of  the house.  I was warmly greeted by Ben, who had been expecting me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was a huge,  dark-skinned  young man.  Six feet two inches tall</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p427"></a><img src="index-427_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">405</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  bull  shoulders  of a  football  lineman,  a  position  he  had played  at  Amherst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ben showed  me into their large living room.  We had a long talk before his father and sister joined us.  He filled  me in on what was happening in  Atlanta.  By  this time he had joined the Party and a considerable  movement had developed around the Herndon case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  ILD office and organization had  heen  established.  The  Party was  still  quite  small,  though  there  were  a  number  of  white members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day Ben took me down to his office on the fifth floor of the Odd Fellows building.  He spoke about the threats against him by the  authorities and  the Ku  Klux  Klan, which was virtually an arm of the state.  Men took off their police uniforms to put on the robes of the Klan.  He talked  of the hounding and the threats as a result  of his  fight  in  the  court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  showed  me  a  hole  in  the  door  between  his  office  and  an adjoining room.  Just a few weeks  after the trial, he was sitting at his desk and noticed  a  kind of tube sticking out of the hole in the door.  Ben went up to examine it and discovered it was the barrel of an empty revolver which was set up against the door.  He pulled a paper out of the barrel and read the message: “The Ku Klux  Klan rides  again.  Georgia is  no place for bad  niggers and red communists.  Next time  well  shoot,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  also  told  me about  what  had  happened  downtown,  at  the ILD office on Peachtree Street.  A white comrade, the wife of ILD </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorney Irving Schwab, was in charge of the office. Ben came into the office,  which  was in  a white neighborhood  downtown, fairly often.  Once, as he was coming out  of the door,  a whole gang was waiting  for  him.  He  thought  they  were  from  the  neighboring offices in  the building,  He was backed up against the  wall, into a corner. No one touched him, but they shouted at him, calling him a nigger  son-of-a-bitch,  threatening to  get  him  or  run  him  out  of town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the jailing  of Angelo  Herndon,  the  authorities assumed they had disposed of one enemy. They now found themselves faced with another one—Ben Davis.  In addition, the Atlanta movement had  begun  to  grow.  There  were  mass  meetings  around  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p428"></a><img src="index-428_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">406</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottsboro  and  Herndon  cases  which  had  drawn  many Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ILD was militant and growing along with a small but active Communist  Party.  While  I was in  Atlanta,  I visited a meeting or two of the ILD and the Party. I recall a Party meeting that was held in the home of the Leathers,  an old white Southern working class family,  long  active  in  radical  politics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  seemed  to  be  about  three  generatioas  of the  Leathers living  in  that  house.  This  included  Nannie  Washburn  who  was then a young mother. Otto had recruited her into the Party and she played a leading role in the Herndon and  Scottsboro defense. She was to remain active in the struggle  long after the Party’s desertion of the  South.  Jailed  in  the  civil  rights  and  anti-war  movements, Mrs.  Washburn  remains  today  a  staunch  fighter in  the  cause  of proletarian  revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was  worried  about  Ben Davis, about  his safety.  I didn’t think the threats were idle—they could  be carried out—especially after the trial, when there was a lull in the movement. Worries 1 had had in  New  York  about the situation in the South were home out  by what 1 now heard in Atlanta. The more I thought about the matter, the  more  I  felt  Ben  should  he  pulled  out  of  there—for  a  time, anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had sized him up as an up-and-coming young communist, with great  leadership  potential.  He  would  be  a  good  addition  to  our growing  body  of  cad res—we  didn’t  need  another  martyr,  we needed living activists.  He was such a dynamic aggressive person; if we got  him to the center and  national  work,  he would develop more  fully  as  a  communist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So upon my return to New York, I presented my opinions to the Politburo—wc  should  draw  him  out  of  Atlanta.  He  agreed  to come  to  New  York,  where  he  was  first  made  editor  of  the <i class="calibre4">Liberator, </i>  relieving  Maude  White;  he later  worked  on the   <i class="calibre4">Daily</i> <i class="calibre4">Worker</i>.  He became a city councilman in the forties and a member of the  Politburo  of the  Party  after  Browder’s demise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  grew  into  an  important  Party leader  with  whom  I  was  to have  strong  political  differences  in  later years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  March  1934,1  was  back  in  Birmingham,  Alabama.  On my previous  visit  Nat  Ross,  the  district  organizer,  had  talked  about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p429"></a><img src="index-429_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">407</p>
<p class="calibre1">building  the  revolutionary  movement  in  Memphis,  along  with New  Orleans,  the  great  financial  and  commercial  center  of  the lower  Mississippi  Valley.  I  had  agreed  on the necessity of such a step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Memphis,  however,  would  be  a  hard  nut  to  crack.  Twice the Party  had  tried  to  build  an  organization  there.  Twice  our organizers  had  been  run  out  of the town  by the  Memphis police. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First  it  was Tom Johnson,  then  I  believe,  Mack  Coad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In those days  Memphis had the reputation of being the murder capital of the nation. It boasted the country’s highest homicide rate and  had attained the distinction by police murders of Blacks.14 In this respect, it was worse than in Birmingham where the growth of the communist movement had resulted in curbing police killings, to  some extent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Memphis, the police were unrestrained; it was open season on Blacks,  especially  on  weekends.  Victims were  usually among the lowest strata, unemployed, friendless and homeless migrants from the countryside seeking employment in the city. They fell into the catch-all  category  of vagrants,  persons  with  no  visible  means  of support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly  a  breakthrough  in  Memphis required careful planning and  most  of all,  capable organizers. Now, according to Nat, these requisites were present.  He had received word from members of a Jewish  branch  of  the  International  Workers  Order  (IWO)  in Memphis  that  they  were  willing  to  subsidize  an  International Labor  Defense  organizer.  The  IWO  was  a  left-wing  insurance organization among whose members were a number of communist and  Party  sympathizers.  I  knew  the  organization,  hut  did  not know  it  had  a  branch  in  Memphis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nat also informed me that there were two young comrades from New  York  available for the project—Forshay, an ILD organizer, and  Boris Israel, a young communist journalist who was writing a series of articles on the South for the   <i class="calibre4">New Masses</i>. Israel offered to accompany  Forshay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,” Nat said, “if we could only find a good Negro comrade.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When  do we leave?”  1  asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  looked  at  me  with  feigned  surprise  and  said,  “You  really</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p430"></a><img src="index-430_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">think you should go,  Harry? And that it would  be alright with the Central  Committee?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of  course,”  1  replied.  I  was  anxious  to  undertake  this assignment,  my first organizing job in the South. I could stay there a little while to help get things started and belp make contacts with the  Black  population. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was  then introduced to the young comrades  and at  midnight we  were  on  our way  to  Memphis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My two young friends, who shared the driving, were in the front seat. When I woke up it was dawn with the Mississippi countryside all  around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  Saturday  morning  and  we  passed  a  number  of trucks loaded with Black sharecroppers and their families, apparently on their  way  to  buy  “stores”  in  Oxford.  Some  of the  trucks  were driven  by  white  Simon  Legree-looking  characters,  whom  I assumed to  he  plantation  riding  bosses  or  planters, We drew  up  to  the  gas station  to  fill  our  tank, just  outside of Oxford.  The attendant, a native cracker type,  peered in at me with an  expression of curiosity on his face, Then, as if he had figured it all  out,  be drawled,  “Wbat’re yo-all  doin’  with  that  boy—taking him  home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said  Boris,  with a mock Mississippi drawl, “takin’ him on  home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  turning to me  the guy said, “Yo glad  to  be home, boy? ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falling into my “field-nigger” drawl,  I replied “Yahza,  cap’n, I shore  am,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We pulled away and drove through the town of Oxford, passing the  old  state  capitol  and  courthouse,  dating  from  ante-bellum times.  (Oxford’s  only claim  to  fame  was  that  it  was the home of William  Faulkner and the University  of Mississippi, “Ole Miss.”) A  short  distance  out  of town,  we  pulled  up  at  the  home  of a comrade  named  Ufe,  whose  address  had  been  given  us  by Ross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ufe’s wife and sister-in-law were the owners of a small plantation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  young  man,  he  had  emigrated  from  his  native  Denmark and  settled  in  the  South,  where  he  married  into  a  former slaveholding family.  By this time, the plantation  had been hard hit by  the  crisis  and  mortgaged  up to the hilt.  There were,  I  believe, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p431"></a><img src="index-431_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">409</p>
<p class="calibre1">five sharecroppers on the place. I was to learn that they considered Ufe  a fair-minded  man.  Their contracts included the right to sell their  own  crop  and  the  right  to  plant  gardens.  The  homes  were equipped  with  electricity  and  running  water.  Recruited  by  Ufe himself,  they  were all  members  of the  Sharecroppers  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite his wife,  Ufe had  never imbibed  the  white supremacist doctrine  and  he  insisted  that  he  was  not  a  planter  but  a  farm manager.  A  member of the  Socialist  Party  of Denmark,  he  had begun to read socialist papers in the U.S., then the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i>, and  was  finally  recruited  into  the  Party  by  the  Birmingham comrades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  pondered this unusual story which I had heard from Ross and others as  we entered the driveway to his  home.  It was an old rundown ante-bellum structure with columns and all. Ufe, a small wiry man,  had been  expecting  us,  and  led  us  into the big living room where  a  dozen  or  so  sharecroppers  and  field  hands were  sitting before a large open fireplace. It was March cold and a huge log was burning.  Ufe  introduced  us  to  the  sharecroppers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we talked, I told them about my visit to Dadcville and other things  in the  outside world.  They all  listened attentively,  We  bad supper  and  stayed  overnight,  His  wife  was  strangely  absent, although  l*d  seen  her puttering  around in  the  kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  left  the  next  morning for  Memphis.  Arriving there  in  the afternoon, we drove directly to the house of a Jewish friend, where the  IWO  was  meeting.  Our  hostess  interrupted  the  meeting, introduced us, and suggested that the matter concerning our visit be  discussed  presently,  under “good  and  welfare.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Israel,  Forshay and  I sat in an adjoining room to wait. I picked up a newspaper lying on the table, I believe it was the   <i class="calibre4">Commercial</i> <i class="calibre4">Appeal</i> one of the city’s big dailies. A front-page article—no more than three or four paragraphs long—caught  my attention. It was a story  about  a  young Black  man  named  Levon  Oarlock who had been killed by police the night before, after allegedly attemptingto rape a  white  woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  the  story  he  had  been shot  while  attempting to escape  the  scene  of the crime.  The  article listed prominently  the names of the officers involved and also the name and address of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">410</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">alleged  rape  victim.  The  murder  of  Blacks  by  the  police  had apparently  become  such  a  routine  matter  that  the  latter  didn’t bother  to  present  even  a  plausible story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  passed  the  paper  over  to  Israel  and  Forshay,  exclaiming, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s  our issue!  Let’s  get to work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  reading  it,  they  simultaneously declared,  “Jesus  Christ! </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s  made  to  order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By this time, the meeting in the adjoining room had come to our point  on the  agenda.  I  looked  over the group.  They were middle class people,  storekeepers and the like, several professionals, and, as  I  later  learned,  one  wealthy jeweler.  I  was  surprised  that  the majority  of the group were young couples, some of them  horn in the  South  and  speaking  with  Southern  drawls.  They  were  very definitely revolutionary  in  sentiment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  were  readers  of  the   <i class="calibre4">Freiheit</i>  (the  Yiddish  language communist daily) and the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker. </i> Several of them, I was to learn,  had  participated  in  the  two  previous  attempts  to  form  a revolutionary organization in  Memphis.  They represented the left wing  of  the  Jewish  community  in  Memphis  and  reflected  the hatred  of an entire community for Boss Crump’s reigning political machine  in  Memphis.  Crump  was  not  only a  rabid  racist,  but  a Jew-hater  as  well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As regarded our mission, there was nothing much to he said. We had  come  there  at  their  invitation.  So  they  proceeded  to  the immediate  question  of  the  subsidy  for  Forshay,  as  the  ILD </p>
<p class="calibre1">organizer.  They  had agreed on a salary of sixteen dollars a week, with  room and board.  He was to stay with the jeweler, who had a large  house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris also was to stay with Forshay at the jeweler’s and I with a young  couple-storekeepers  who  lived  close  to  the  Black  neighborhood. That settled, I informed the group about the news article concerning the  alleged  rape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their response was “this happens every day”—it was a common thing.  They  described  the  heating  and  killing  of  Blacks  in  the station  house,  of young  Black  boys disappearing after they were taken  to  the  station  by  police,  about  Blacks  being  beaten unconscious  right  out  on the  street. </p>

<p class="calibre1">411</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were  anxious  to  pick  up  on  the issue while it was hot.  We sent  Boris  Israel  to  check  on  the  story  while  Forshay  and  I remained at  the  house,  where  we set up temporary headquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  were  quite  fortunate  to  have  on  our  team  a  man like  Boris,  with  his  experience  and  training  as  an  investigative reporter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several  hours  later  he returned,  having  uncovered  a  shocking story of racism,  murder and police hrutality.  He had gone directly to  the  address  of the “rape  victim,”  whom  he  had  found  to  be a prostitute  living  in  the  red light  district  that  adjoined  the  Black neighborhood.  Interviewing  her,  he  had  found  gaping  irregularities  in  her  obviously  rehearsed  story.  At  first  she  had talked openly,  unrestrainedly about  her “horrendous experience.” Then suddenly  she  clammed  up,  blurting  out,  “The  police cap’n  said  I was  not  to talk  to  anybody.” Then  she closed the door on  Boris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris  then  interviewed  the  widow  of the  murdered man.  She lived in a rooming house not far from the scene. She was just a slip of a girl—sixteen she said—but looked even younger. The incident had left her in a state of shock.  She was being consoled hy an older woman, who turned out to be a maid who lived in the whorehouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She began to tell her story. She and her seventeen-year-old husband,  Levon  Carlock,  were newly  married and  had just come up from  Mississippi,  where  both  their  families  were  ruined  sharecroppers.  She  had  gotten  a job  as  a  maid  in  one  of  the  white whorehouses.  Levon,  who was  still  unemployed,  would  come to pick  her  up  every-night  at  about  2:00  A.M.  and escort her home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the night of the tragedy, he had been waiting out in the street for  her  as  usual,  when  the  police  officers  shot  him  down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overcome  by  grief,  Mrs.  Carlock  then  burst  into  tears  and could  no  longer  continue.  At  this  point,  the  older  woman led  Boris  into  another  room  and  continued  the  story.  She had seen the whole incident from a second-story window above the alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said four policemen had taken Levon around into the alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  had  heard  noises  and  cursing,  cries  of “you  Black  son-of-a-bitch.”  “You’re  the  nigger  that  raped  that  white woman.”  They were  beating  the  poor  youth  unmercifully  with  their  clubs  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">412</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">fists,  she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Levon kept protesting that he had come to take his wife home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  one of the officers appeared escorting a white woman. She said, ,4I recognized her as one of the prostitutes that lives across the street” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  the  officers  asked  the  woman  if Levon  was the one that had tried to rape her,  and  she said “Yeah,  he’s the one.” Then she went  back to  her  house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They started  beating Levon again, knocking him to the ground and pulling out their revolvers.  Levon hegged for his life, but it did no  good.  “They  shot  him down in  cold  hlood,  right  there  in the alley,” she said.  As they turned and walked away, one of the cops said,  “You  know that  nigger son-of-a-hitch  is still alive?’  I guess they  heard  moaning.  They  stopped,  and one of the officers went over  and  pointed his  pistol  at  Levon’s  head and  blew  his  brains out  right  there  in  the  alley.  Then  a  short  time  later,  a  Black undertaker came and took his body. The police must have had him laying  in  wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Carlock had heard some of tbis, but hadn’t seen it. She had fainted and after she had come to,  was hysterical.  We kept her in the  house  overnight;  the  landlady  gave  her  some  pills.  In  the morning,  I  went  with  her  to  the  undertaker  to  identify  Levon’s body.  Later we  got  the  maid  to  put  her  story  in  an affidavit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,  there  it  was.  A  perfect  issue! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoping  through  such  a  mass campaign  that  we could  build  a Party  organization  in  Memphis,  we  immediately  began  our campaign to  stir up  Memphis.  We knew that the issue would take hold of the  Black population and we hoped to take advantage of the  anti-Crump  sentiment  among whites  to win some of them to our side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We set out to huild a broad united  front, under the auspices of the  LSNR,  which I represented,  and  the ILD. Then and there we worked out a leaflet, slogans and plan of action. Our slogans were: </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop  Police  Murder  of Negroes  in  Memphis!*’  “Levon  Carlock Must  Be  the  Last!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We called for immediate expulsion of the officers involved, their arrest  and  prosecution  on  charges  of  first  degree  murder  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p435"></a><img src="index-435_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">413</p>
<p class="calibre1">indemnity  to  the  widow.  Our  program  of action  called  for  the establishment  of hlock  and  neighborhood committees  and  mass protest  meetings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  slogans  caught  fire.  Within  two  or three  weeks  we  had  a considerable movement going.  Outside of our Jewish friends, we knew  no  one  in  Memphis,  but  they  introduced  us  to  their  few acquaintances among Blacks. Our most important contact was tbe editor of the   <i class="calibre4">Memphis  World\</i>  Memphis’s  Black newspaper, and his staff. They were sympathetic and wanted something to be done about the murders.  Then  we met  with  a number of lower echelon leaders—ministers,  educators,  lodge leaders  and  a  few  businessmen.  We soon had an ad hoc committee going, while we stayed in the background.  A number of meetings were called at which Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oarlock  appeared,  and  some neighborhood or block committees were set  up  as  a  result. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  beginning,  we  had contacted  the  national  office  of the ll.D  and informed Patterson of our plans. We called for a nationwide  support  campaign,  linked  up  with  the  Scottsboro  and I lemdon campaigns. The national office gave us a green light to go ahead  with  our  plans  and  get  a local  (white)  lawyer to prosecute our case against  the  police. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  rain  of telegrams  from  across  the  country  poured  into the Memphis mayor’s office and the   <i class="calibre4">Memphis  World</i> carried news of (he  campaign.  Our  Jewish  friends  succeeded  in  getting  a  local lawyer,  a  white  anti-Crump  man.  “He  didn’t  care  so  much about  Negroes,  hut  he  sure  hated  Crump!”  they  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  campaign  spread.  Its effectiveness  was  confirmed  by  two Incidents.  Our  friends  on  the   <i class="calibre4">World</i>  kept  us  informed  about everything  going  on  in  the  community.  They  told  us  that  a delegation of Uncle Tom leaders had gone to see the mayor. They were  alarmed  by  the  threat  our campaign  posed  to  their leader-nhip—they were unahle to keep the Blacks in line. They pleaded for at  least  some  token  concession  on  the  part  of  the  police.  For example,  a  statement  from  the  mayor  to  the  effect  that  an investigation would be held. Something they could use to counter the “red  invasion”  of the  Black  community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  mayor not  only  refused  to  budge,  hut told the delegation</p>

<p class="calibre1">414</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  police  were  doing  their  duty—and  they  had  better  do theirs!  The city and  police,  he asserted,  would brook no rebellion from  the  niggers—and  you’d  better  tell  your  folk  that,  too! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  regards  the  ‘Ted  invasion,”  the  mayor  said  that  he  was aware  that  there  were a dozen  or so reds in the city and that they would be taken care of when the time came. They were apparently waiting for  a lull  in  the  movement  to  move  in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  also  through  the   <i class="calibre4">World</i> people that  we  met  Robert  E* </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lee,  a  lieutenant  of Bob Church, the Black  Republican  National Committeeman  from  Memphis.  Lee  himself  was  a  prominent man  in  the  community.  He  sought  us  out  to  inform  us  (in private)  that  Boh  Church  liked  what  we  were doing and  wanted us to keep it up.  He evidently felt that our campaign strengthened his  position  vis-a-vis  Boss  Crump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daisy  Lampkin,  national field  secretary of the  NAACP, came tq  Memphis  in the midst of our campaign. She came there to help the local  branch in its annual membership drive and was unaware of the  growing movement  initiated  by the ILD.  The  whole thing was quite an unpleasant surprise for the woman. The Party and the ILD  had  had  run-ins  with her regarding Scottsboro, and  she became frantic when she found out about our work in Memphis. Her campaign  was  low  key;  conducted  under the  abstract  slogans  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Equal  justice  and  opportunity,”  which  carefully  avoided  the burning  issue  of police  murders  right  under  our  noses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  NAACP was in  an embarrassing spot.  They called  a mass meeting  in  one  of the  largest  churches  in  connection  with  their membership  drive  campaign.  We  invaded  it,  with  Mrs.  Carlock dressed in mourning black, and demanded a place on the platform for her.  As  1  remember, she was given the platform and she spoke of  the  murder,  asking  for  help  from  the  NAACP  to  prevent anything of this .sort from happening again. She proposed a united front of the NAACP,  1LD and LSNR against police brutality. The chairman passed it off by referring it to the local board.  But after the meeting,  Lee told us later, the proposal failed to pass the board by  only  one  vote—he  personally  had  voted  for  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  to  be  the  beginning  of a  downturn in  our  fortunes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next  was  the  disappearance  of our  star  witness,  the  maid  who</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p437"></a><img src="index-437_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SHARECROPPERS  WITH  GUNS</p>
<p class="calibre1">415</p>
<p class="calibre1">Win kcd  at  the whorehouse.  The  local  attorney asked us to  bring tin up to his office, but when we went to get her, she had gone. She ilhlu’t  work  there  anymore.  We  speculated  that  the  police  had h Ighiened her into leaving town after we sent the affidavit she had given us to the national office and they had published it—cither in Ihc   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> or the   <i class="calibre4">Labor Defender</i>,  We had a weak reed in I hr  first  place,  since she  was  vulnerable  herself to  a frame-up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ihc legal side of the case was  important,  but now our attorney was helpless without a witness. Without the legal case, we couldn’t hrep up with the public campaign and it began to lose momentum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ihc situation was becoming threatening. The cops were getting irmly to move in. We discussed this with our friends and they said wr’d  made  a  hell  of a  good  fight,  but  it  would  be  better  to  send inuicone else in, now that we were known.  So the three of us went ih lo the office of the   <i class="calibre4">Memphis  World</i> and the editor said we were lucky,  we had just missed the four cops who were looking for us, Wc decided  it was time to leave town. We first decided to go by Ihc  telegraph station to pick  up some money Patterson had wired tm.  Forshay  and  Israel  went  in  to get the money.  I stood outside waiting for them.  Two cops came up and  looked  at the  Alabama license  plate  on  the  car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Forshay and  Israel came out  of the office—Boris took in Ihc scene  in a  glance.  He jumped  into the car and shouted at me, M</p>
<p class="calibre1">(  nine on,  Sam!  Let’s  get  out  of heah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yassuh,” I drawled, and  climbed  in the back. We kept driving until  we got to  Mississippi! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t a total defeat.  Forshay stayed behind and continued to ntgiinize for  the ILD.  Our work  put the cops on  notice that  they couldn't get away with the kind of crap they had been dishing out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I he raw stuff had to stop; otherwise they would have trouble. The Hood  of telegrams  had  an  impact.  It aLso helped  lay the  base for future  activity there. </p>
