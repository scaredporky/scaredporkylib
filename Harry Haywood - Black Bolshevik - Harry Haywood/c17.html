<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Against  War  and  Fascism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in New  York, I  began to take stock of myself as a  Party leader.  I  had  risen  rapidly  in the Party hierarchy during the four years since my return from the Soviet Union. I was now a member of  the  Politburo  and  head  of the  National  Negro  Department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the importance of my post, I was dissatisfied with my own personal development. True, I was regarded as a promising young theoretician.  But  1  felt  a  lack  of experience in  direct  mass work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the general orientation of the Negro Commission was towards  promoting mass  activities  in  the field  of Afro-American work,  I  found  my job  mainly  confined  to  inner-Party  activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  actual  work  included  checking  on the  work  of the districts, particularly  the  Negro Commissions that existed on each district level,  consulting  with  district  leaders,  training  cadres,  organizing education  on  the  Afro-American question  for  national and district  training  schools  and  preparing  resolutions  and  articles on  the  question.  I  had  little  contact  with  the  masses  outside the Party.  Therefore,  I  had  originally  welcomed  the decision to huild the LSNR with myself as national secretary. I had expected it to be an  opportunity to  get  into  mass  work.  The failure of the LSNR, however,  had  eliminated  that  opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was increasingly tied  down to the office on  the ninth floor of the  Party’s  national  headquarters  on  Twelfth  Street  in  lower Manhattan  and  faced  the  specter  of becoming an  internal  Party functionary  or  bureaucrat. </p>

<p class="calibre1">442</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this situation my relations with James Ford became strained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ford  was  the  only  other  Black  Politburo  member  and  now headed  the  Party’s  Harlem  organization,  a  major  concentration point  in  the  Party’s  work  among  Blacks.  Ford  and  I  had disagreements over such things as assignments of cadres, but I felt the main cause of friction was Ford’s personal ambition. Ford was a  man  of  considerable  organizational  ability,  but  Browder  was able  to  play  on  his  weaknesses  and  use  him  as  a  vehicle  for winning the Black cadre to his developing liquidationist line on the Afro-American  question.  Thus,  Ford,  supported  by  Browder, built  a  power  base—almost  a c liq u e -in   Harlem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  felt  it  was  impossible  to  work  in  this  atmosphere.  Thus  I requested  to  be transferred to Chicago, something I  had thought about  before  these  tensions  had  matured.  My  request  was approved in late  1934 and  I left  New  York for Chicago.  After my departure,  Ford,  with  Abner  Berry’s  assistance,  took  over  as responsible head  of the Negro  Department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As head of the Negro Department, I had kept in close touch with the  Chicago  comrades.  The  Party  in  Chicago  was  beginning to grow.  A  large  number  of  recruits  were  from  the  disintegrating Garvey movement, obviously attracted by the Party’s work among the unemployed, Scottsboro, and its program in favor of the right to  self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chicago was the country’s second largest Black city and had tbe greatest  concentration  of  Black  industrial  workers.  In  the  early thirties, the city was the scene of some of the fiercest battles of the unemployed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  summer  of  1930,  the  city  was  the  site  of the  founding convention  of the  National  Unemployed  Councils.  Led  hy  communists,  the  councils  fought  for  relief in  cash  and jobs,  unemployment insurance, public works jobs at union wages, hot lunches for  school  children,  a  moratorium  on  evictions  and  an  end  to discrimination against Blacks. Chicago’s first Unemployed Council was  formed  on  the  Southsidc  in  the  fall  of  1930,  with  Black workers  playing a  leading role.  Blacks constituted eleven percent of the city’s population,  but  were one-fourth of all the relief cases in  the  city.  Chicago’s  Southside  Blacks  were  among  the  worst</p>

<p class="calibre1">CHICAGO:  AGAINST WAR  AND  FASCISM</p>
<p class="calibre1">443</p>
<p class="calibre1">auffcrers  of the  Depression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chicago’s  unemployed,  led  by  the  Communist  Party,  were exemplary in carrying out energetic activities and demonstrations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  50,000  marched  through  the  Loop  to  Grant  Park  in  the summer of 1931, baiting traffic and forcing police to back off from a  planned  confrontation.  Earlier  that  summer  there  was  a mammoth  march  on  the  state  capital  in  Springfield  demanding that  relief cutbacks  be restored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  real  growth  and  consolidation  of  the  movement followed  the  police  murder  of  four  Black  workers  (Ahe  Gray, John  O’Neil,  Thomas  Paige  and  Frank  Armstrong)  as  they attempted  to  prevent  the  eviction  of  a  seventy-year-old  Black widow,  Dianna  Gross.  This event—known  as  the  Chicago  massacre—occurred when police opened fire into a large crowd which was  trying  to put  the  woman’s  furniture  back  into  her  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  local  Party leader who was on the spot at the time  described the tremendous demonstrations and actions that surrounded these brutal  murders.  The  funeral  of Gray and O’Neil was the greatest demonstration  of  Black  and  white  solidarity  that  she  had  ever witnessed.  Crowds  of  white  people  poured  into  State  Street  in solidarity  with  their  Black  brothers.  They  marched from Thirty-first  Street,  behind  the  coffins,  south  to  the  Englewood  Station where the bodies were put aboard a train to return to their homes in  the  South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  crowd  just  took  over State  Street—there  wasn’t  a  cop  in sight.  As  people  walked,  they carried open  sheets with them; the crowds  watching on the sidewalk threw money into the sheets, to help  defray  the  families’  expenses.  We  estimated  over  30,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">people were there.  For a considerable period of time following this march,  the  evictions  were  halted  and  the  unemployment  movement  grew  in  leaps  and  bounds.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a direct relationship in Chicago between this growth and our work on Scottsboro. The case had a tremendous impact on the  Black community  there.  White comrades doing work among the unemployed  told  us that the case was really an entree into the community.  Once  people  knew  that  they  were communists, they were  accepted  because  communists  were  always  associated  with</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottsboro.  The  normal  suspicion  of  whites  in  the  Black  community was greatly lessened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The city administration's answer to this growing movement wa» </p>
<p class="calibre1">unbridled police terror. A tool of the corrupt city government and allied  with gangsters, Chicago's police force undoubtedly held the record  for  terror  and  lawlessness  against  workers.  They  were unsurpassed  for sadism and  brutality,  regularly  raiding the  halls and  offices  of the  Unemployed  Councils,  revolutionary  organizations and the P arty—smashing furniture, beating workers in the halls,  on the  streets  and  in  the p red net stations.  Hundreds  were arrested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1930,  the  police  murdered  Lee  Mason,  a  Black  communist candidate for Congress.  Harold Williams, a Party organizer in the Southsidc  and  an  old  schoolmate  of  mine  from  Moscow,  was viciously  beaten.  Although hospitalized,  he never fully recovered arid  died  a  few  years  later in New  York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took courage and on occasion  ingenuity to thwart the police terror  aimed  at  forcibly  stifling  and  demoralizing  the  workers’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">movement  One  example  of  both  was  Herbert  Newton,  a  Black memher  of  the  Central  Committee  and  Party  organizer  in  the Southside.  On one occasion he was speaking before a large crowd in Ellis Park. The police arrived, determined to stop Newton from speaking  and  to  break  up  the  meeting.  But  Newton,  moving quickly,  climbed up  an old  oak tree and  kept right on talking.  A9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> reported:  “Some  of the uniformed killers tried to  climb up  after him,  but their graft-swollen bellies interfered.”3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  crowd  laughed  as  they  left  and  Newton  climhed  down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I arrived in Chicago late in  1934, the Depression was in its fourth  year.  The  determined  mass  struggle  had  wrung  some concessions  from  the  Roosevelt government  and the spirit  of the people  was  raised  by  these victories, 1 stepped off the train on a wintery day in late fall. I was greeted by  a  surprise welcoming  committee  including  Claude  Lightfoot, Katy  White and John Gray,  They informed  me of a banquet they had planned for that evening to welcome me to the district.  During the  day  1  visited  with  my  family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hall that  evening was filled. There were comrades from the</p>

<p class="calibre1">CHICAGO:  AGAINST WAR  AND  FASCISM</p>
<p class="calibre1">445</p>
<p class="calibre1">diulrict  -many of whom  I  already knew and with whom I was to work  in  the  coming  months.  There  was  Morris  Childs,  district mgiini/er  and  former  Lenin  School  classmate;  Bca  Shields, tducttiional  director;  and  Joe  Weber,  leader  of the unemployed movement.  From  the  Southside  came  Claude  Lightfoot,  a  YCL </p>
<p class="calibre1">1#mlcr; David Poindexter from the LSNR; Brown Squire, from the packing  houses;  Delia  Page,  active  in  the  unemployed  work; Oliver  Law,  head  of the  Southside  ILD;  and  other  stalwarts.  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">knew  I  was  among  old  friends.  The  speakers  were  enthusiastic, pledging support for the work on the Southside. They called on all il»p  comrades  to  intensify  their  efforts  and  give  me  their  full fttipport.  I  was  somewhat  embarrassed  by  the  overwhelming warmth  and  comradeship  shown  that  evening  and  left  in  high iplrits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greetings  from  another  source  came the  next  morning.  1  was apeaking at  a demonstration in front of the “Fortress of Misery” </p>
<p class="calibre1">relief station at 505 East 50th Street. A police patrol wagon drove up,  several cops jumped out and rushed the speaker’s stand. They dragged  me off and hustled  me, along with Tom Trent (Hyde Park <b class="calibre3">Yt'l  </b>organizer)  and  Edelman  (a  young  white  University  of ( 'liicago student),  off to the  Forty-eighth Street Precinct Station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hey  booked  us  on  disorderly  conduct  or some  such  ridiculous charge.  We then were taken to the Twelfth Street Detective Bureau for  fingerprinting  and  “mugging.”  Here  was  my  first  encounter with  Lt.  Murphy  of Chicago’s  Red  Squad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  <i class="calibre4">you're</i> the new nigger red from New York who they’ve been banqueting.  Well, when we get  through with you, you’ll wish you Were  hack  east.  By the way,  how’s  old  Williams doing?” (He  was ralcrring  here  to  the  severe  beating  that  Harold  Williams  had received  in  1931.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">They drove us back to the Forty-eighth Street Station and threw Uft  in  a  cell.  Shortly  after,  two  plainclothesmen  appeared.  “You Haywood?” they asked. “Captain Mooney wants to see you.” They guided me towards the office and on the way one asked, “You ever <b class="calibre3">met </b>Captain Mooney? Well, you’re going to meet him nowand I’d hale  to  be  in  your  shoes.”  (Mooney  later  led  the  Republic  Steel Maasacre  of  1937.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p468"></a><img src="index-468_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">446</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">As they led me through the door, I saw Mooney—big, red-faced and  brutal  looking  -sitting  behind  the  desk.  “So  you’re  Haywood—you goddamn nigger son-of-a-bitch, we’ll banquet you all right!  Now  take  him  away!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few hours later I was taken back to see Mooney and the same scene was repeated.  In late afternoon we were taken out and lined up  in front of the guards as the shift  changed.  There were several Black  cops  among  them.  “Now get  a  good  look  at  these  three,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mooney told them. “They’re around here trying to stir up the poor colored people.  Whenever you see them, I want you to run ’em in,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  spending  the  day  in  jail  we  were  brought  before  the magistrate,  fined  and  released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The greetings  were over, it was  now time to get down to work, Chicago  District  Eight included all of Illinois, parts of Wisconsin, Indiana,  Iowa and Missouri.  I was installed as Southside regional organizer.  My  region  included  the  Southside  Black  Belt  wards, Hyde  Park  and  Englewood.  At  the  same  time,  I  was  elected chairman  of the  Cook  County  Committee  of the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  I  first  arrived  the  mass  struggles,  particularly  of  the unemployed, had ebbed from the peak reached a year or so earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strikes  and  unemployed  marches  throughout  the  country  had wrenched limited concessions in the form of the first round of New Deal  legislation—the National  Industrial  Recovery Act, Agricultural  Adjustment  Act,  etc.  The national  economy  had  improved somewhat—profits  had risen significantly, production was fifteen percent higher than the low point of 1932, and unemployment had dropped  three  million,  although  over  thirteen  million  remained jobless. These factors all helped to ease the situation of the masses somewhat.  But  this  upturn  didn’t  affect  Southside Blacks  much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Last hired, fifty percent were unemployed, as compared with only twenty-four percent  of whites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, these improvements signaled a new offensive by  monopoly  capital.  With  the  depth  of the crisis  behind  them, they were now confident they could put an end to the reforms they had  temporarily  accepted  and  move  the  country  in  a  fascist direction.  The  Supreme  Court  declared  key New  Deal  programs unconstitutional.  Roosevelt  chose to move a “little left of center” </p>

<p class="calibre1">447</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  strengthen  his  position among the workers,  and  presented the Congress  with  a  second  round  of New  Deal  legislation —Works Progress  Administration  (WPA),  the  Wagner  Act  (National Labor Relations Act, which guaranteed labor's right to organize), the  Social  Security  Act  (which  established  small  federal  benefits for the‘aged  and  the  unemployed). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lull in mass activity, the growing conflicts in the ruling class, and  the  rapidly  changing  international  situation  marked  the beginning of a new period. All the struggles of the future would be marked  by the growing threat of fascism—at home and abroad— </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  our tactics  would  change accordingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  felt  that  what  was  needed  was  a  clear  program  of action embracing the Black masses together with  white toilers, aimed at building a broad united front movement. After much discussion in the  region,  a  plan  of action  was  adopted.  It  called  for  concentration  on  the  three  most  pressing issues  of the  time:  relief,  high rents  and  the  higb cost of living.  We called  for a special  focus on the rights of Blacks for whom, because of Jim Crow, suffering was particularly  sharp.  We  organized  around  the  slogans  of “Drive down  rents!”  “Abolish  rent  differences  in  Negro  and  white neighborhoods!” “Increase cash relief1.” “Smash Jim Crow  methods  of relief distribution!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">HANDS  OFF  ETHIOPIA</p>
<p class="calibre1">On  July  25,  1935,  the  historic  Seventh  Congress  of  the Communist  International  opened  in  Moscow  and  met in session until August21. TheU.S. Party sent a strong delegation, including an  impressive group  of Black  comrades.  Among  them  were  Ben Careathers, Pittsburgh's “Rock of Gibraltar”; Claude Lightfoot (I was  happy  to see  him  go  to  further  his  political  experience); the sharecropper leader and  organizer  A1  Murphy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  Chicago,  we  followed  the  proceedings  of  the  congress closely.  How to prevent fascism, and how to overthrow it where it already  had  come  to  power,  were  the  questions  facing  the Congress.  In  his  main  report,  Georgi  Dimitrov,  hero  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p470"></a><img src="index-470_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">448</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reichstag fire trial, defined fascism as “the open terrorist dictatorship  of  the  most  reactionary,  most  chauvinistic and  most  imperialist  elements  of finance  capital.” ’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  congress  called  upon  the  parties  to  build  broad  people’s fronts  against  war  and  fascism.  These  anti-fascist  fronts  would include  workers  and  farmers,  intellectuals  .and  all  democratic sections  of the  population.  The  parties  were  urged  to  take  into consideration  the changed  conditions in the world  situation,  and to  apply the united front tactics in  a new manner. While pointing out  the  need  for  such  broad  unity,  at  the  same  time  Dimitrov warned  against  the communist  parties’ losing their independence and  freedom  of  action  and  abdicating  their  leading  role  within the anti-fascist  front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  February  1935,  Italian  troops  were  already  massing  in Eritrea,  obviously  preparing to  invade.  By summer,  Italy openly proclaimed  its  goal  of annexing  Ethiopia,  The  fascist  threat  to Ethiopia aroused deep anger in the Black communities throughout the  country.  Anticipating  the  call  of  the  Seventh  Congress,  we Southside communists seized the initiative to build a broad united front  struggle  against  the growing threat of war and  fascism.  An emergency Southside conference was held on July 10,1935, to plan a  campaign  to  defend  and  support  Ethiopia.  The  response  was overwhelming.  Over  1,100  delegates  attended,  representing  all manner  of  Black  community  organizations:  churches,  lodges, dubs,  Black nationalist groups and the Black YWCA, as well as a number  of Italian  anti-fascist  groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolutionary-led  organizations  such  as  the  ILD,  the  Unemployed Councils and the League Against War and Fascism, as well as  the  Communist  and  Socialist  Parties,  took  part.  It  was  a genuine  citywide  people’s  front  with  the  Southside  as  its  base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From this  enthusiastic conference, the Joint Committee for the Defense  of  Ethiopia  was  formed.  Plans  were immediately </p>
<p class="calibre1">launched for a  mass “Hands Off Ethiopia” parade on  August 31, 1935,  and  a  petition  drive  for  500,000  signatures  calling  upon Congress  to  invoke  the  Kellogg  Peace  Pact  and  embargo  arms shipments  to Italy.  A demonstration was also called in front of the Italian  Consulate  on  North  Wells  Street  before  the  August  31</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p471"></a><img src="index-471_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">CHICAGO.  AGAINST  WAR  AND  FASCISM</p>
<p class="calibre1">449</p>
<p class="calibre1">parade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  Black  Americans,  Ethiopia  had  always  been  a symbol  of freedom  and  independence  in  history  and  folklore.  Masses  of Black  people  strongly  supported  Ethiopia.  Their  readiness  to defend  Ethiopia  from  fascist invasion was  linked  to  the struggle against  the  enemy  at  home.  The  defense  of  Ethiopia  inevitably became  a  fight  against  the  growth  of fascism  right  in  Chicago, against  every  petty  persecution,  Jim  Crow  degradation,  misery and  discrimination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  city  administration  made  this  strikingly clear  by  immediately  refusing  to  grant  a  parade  permit  for  the  ‘'Hands  Off Ethiopia”  march.  Mayor  Kelly,  who  had just  received  an  award from  Mussolini  himself,  sought  to  justify  this  denial  on  the political grounds that the parade .would be an affront to Italy—a </p>
<p class="calibre1">“friendly  power.” (Ethiopia,  whilefriendly, was  not considered  a power.)  But  the underlying  reason  for their fear was what  might happen  if the Black  masses  took  to the streets—the specter of the massive 1931-32 unemployed upsurge which had shaken Chicago’s Southside  was  still  with  them.  The  police  and  administration knew only too  well that the deep-rooted emotion of the Blacks in Chicago  for defense of Ethiopia could very quickly develop into a new  wave  of  mass  actions  among  the  jobless  starving  families around the relief stations and against their domestic oppressors in the  steel  mills  and  stockyards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  evident  that  the  Kelly  administration  brought  pressure upon the joint committee and caused a number of ministers to bolt the coalition. Amongthem was the Reverend J.O. Austin, minister of the Pilgrim Baptist Church, one of the largest Black churches in the city and host to the July conference. The reformist leaders were afraid of the “red menace,” afraid that they could no longer control the  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This temporary setback caused us to make a closer evaluation of our united  front activity.  We had relied too much on building the united  front  through  negotiations  at  the  top  and  had  not emphasized mobilizing the Party to work i n the reformist-led mass organizations—churches,  lodges  and  unions.  We  had  clearly underestimated  the  importance  of  work  within  these  organi</p>

<p class="calibre1">zations.  After a  succssful  fight  against  these  tendencies,  we were able to rebuild the joint committee on a new basis, continuing our efforts  to  organize  for  the  August  31  demonstration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our plan for escalating actions began on August  14, when more than 2,000 Black and white workers attended three mass rallies on the Southside.  1 remember that on this occasion, young comrades in  the  YCL  and  the  Young  Liberators  (a  communist-led  predominantly  Black  youth  organization),  hanged  an  effigy  of Mussolini  to  the cheers  of hundreds  in the  crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  planning conference  on  August  19  at  Lincoln  Center drew together more than sixty-five delegates and many more unofficial observers  and  visitors  from  forty  organizations.  Rev.  Kinsley  of the  Church  of  the  Good  Shepherd  was  elected  chairman  of the joint  committee  and  Arthur  Falls,  prominent  young  Black  surgeon,  became  its  secretary.  Delegations  were  chosen  to  visit leading churches and community  organizations on the Southside to mobilize thousands for the upcoming parade. Everyone attending got copies of the call and i(Hands Off Ethiopia*9 buttons to take back  to  their  organizations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The following day, a delegation chosen at the planning meeting once  again  visited  Mayor  Kelly  to  demand  a  permit  to  march. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  again,  we were  refused.  The coalition  had by now  received the endorsements of the local Socialist Party and executive council of the  Chicago  AFL. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actions continued with a protest at the Italian Consulate.  I was  among  a  delegation  who  met  with  the  consul  to  demand immediate withdrawal  of Italian  troops  from  Africa, The young comrades on the outside who were very adept at this type of dramatic action carried on a  demonstration during lunch hour. Two young girls, one white and one Black, were handcuffed to  a  light  pole  in  front  of  the  consulate.  They  wore  white sweatshirts  on  which  were  printed  the  slogans,  “Down  with Mussolini,  Hands Off Ethiopia!” It took the  police ten or twenty minutes to file through their chains, enough time for a huge lunch hour  crowd  to  gather  and  for them  to  make  speeches and shout slogans.  Sidewalk  as well as street traffic was  blocked. To add to the  confusion  of  the  police,  others  showered  the  crowd  with</p>

<p class="calibre1">We had other flash actions in the downtown area. A hundred or so of us would blend in with the crowd in the busy Loop area and at a  signal  from  the  leader  would  draw  out  hidden  placards  and leaflets.  I  could  see the  looks  of amazement and  disbelief on the faces  of  the  cops  when  this  happened.  Having  received  no instructions from  their superiors,  the police were shocked to see a full-sized  sidewalk  parade  suddenly  materialize  seemingly  from nowhere.  After  a  few  blocks,  the  demonstrators  would  discard their signs and disperse. All of these were build-ups for our August 31  parade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  groundwork  was  successful.  The  entire  Southside  community was in a state of anticipation and in addition  the Chicago Party organization had mobilized support from all sections of the city. But there was still one hitch. Maypf Kelly and Chief of Police Allman  continued  to  reject  our  application  for  a  parade  permit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The joint  committee sent delegation after delegation of prominent people,  Black and white, but the chief was adam ant- -there would be  no  permit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  was  the  situation  at  the  final  meeting  of  our  joint committee on Friday, the eve of the demonstration, where we were to make the final preparations for the parade. Lincoln Center was packed  with  people.  Spirits  were  not  dampened;  we were determined  to  go  on  with  the  parade.  As  the  Party’s  Southside spokesman,  1  was  told  that  I  made  one  of  the  most  spirited speeches.  It  was  unanimously  decided  that we would “assert  our democratic  rights”  and  march  in defiance  of the  police  ban. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parade marshals were appointed and the line of march mapped out.  The  meeting  adjourned  amid  defiant  speeches.  But  we communists  were  under  no  illusions.  We  knew  that  the  police would  not  even  allow  us  to  assemble.  Our  intelligence  had informed  us  that  2,000  cops  would  concentrate in  the  assemhly area,  that  all  leaves  had  been canceled  and  extra  duty assigned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were preparing for a real showdown. The defense of Ethiopia had  now  become  a  fight  for the streets  of Chicago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the meeting adjourned, we communists got together.  As 1 </p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Law,  Tom  Trent  and  myself  (Claude  Lightfoot  was  in  Moscow attending the Seventh Congress of the CL) What we feared might happen  was  that the crowds would be dispersed without any kind of  demonstration.  We  felt  that  this  would  be  a  demoralizing setback.  Therefore  we  planned  alternate  demonstrations,  dramatic  actions  of  all  sorts,  including  speaking  from  rooftops, burning of effigies of Mussolini, blocking traffic and other actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to carry this out, our people had to get into the assembly area  that  night  (it  was  already  midnight  when  the  meeting adjourned)  and stay.  We knew that no known communists would be allowed  into the  area  the  next  day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  chose  to  speak  from  the  roof  of  a  five-story  hotel  on  the southwest  corner  of  Forty-seventh  and  South  Parkway.  I  went straight from the meeting and  rented a room on the fifth  floor of the hotel, concealing a megaphone in my bag. I woke early, went to the roof and  surveyed  the  scene of the upcoming battle.  It was a bright,  warm  day  and  I  could  see  that  the  police-hundreds  of them—were already forming their lines. A string of patrol wagons were visible near the “L” station, waiting to be filled. I went back to my room and a  comrade brought me coffee and a newspaper and reported  on what was going on.  Around one o’clock 1 went  back up  to  the  roof.  The  streets  were  filled  with  shoppers,  men  and women  returning  from  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  the  demonstrators  began  arriving;  streams  of  them, striding expectantly down the steps from the “Lw station.  And the action  began. The police assumed  most whites getting off the UL” </p>
<p class="calibre1">in this  part  of town, the heart of Black Chicago, must be therefor the demonstration. They began indiscriminately herding them into patrol  wagons  and  hustling them  off to the station.  They limited the arrests among Blacks to a few well-known leaders. The whole police  plan  was  orchestrated  by  Mike  Mills  of the  Chicago  Red Squad.  Their strategy was to spare  Blacks the brunt of the attack because a direct attack in this part of town could set off a full-scale riot.  In  this  way,  they  hoped to split the demonstrators and  thus make  it  easier  to  disperse them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  my  vantage  point,  I  could  see  the  scene  unfolding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pandemonium  broke  loose—the  streets  were crowded  with</p>

<p class="calibre1">CHICAGO:  AGAINST WAR  AND  FASCISM</p>
<p class="calibre1">453</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstrators  and  shoppers alike.  As arrests  were made,  people began  shouting  protests  and  slogans.  I  saw  Oliver  Law jump  up und  begin  addressing  the  crowd  from  a  roof very  near  the  “L” </p>
<p class="calibre1">station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  caught  the  police  off guard  and  it took some time before Ihey  could  get  to  him.  But  as  soon as Law was pulled  down and arrested,  another  speaker  began  on  a roof across the street.  This was  repeated  five  or  six  times  as  the  police  moved frantically to silence  the  speakers.  By  this  time,  the  crowd  had  grown  considerably and  the streets and  sidewalks  were jammed.  Every time we would outsmart  the police,  a great  roar would go up from the crowd—and every time another arrest was  made, they would jeer the  cops.  Milton  Howard,  the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker's</i>  man-on-the-spot, described  the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  2,000  uniformed  police with  revolvers and  clubs lined up through a quarter mile radius from  the corners where the dem onstration  was  to  have  begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the  10,000 Negro and white enemies of w ar who gathered to  raise their voices  in solidarity with the independent Negro country  facing  the  war  menace  of  fascist  troops  were  not easily  intim idated.  Driven  and  herded  from   one  corner  to another,  dispersed  by  proddings  from  clubs  and  revolver butts,  scattered  groups  held  stubbornly the im m ediate neighborhood  from   the  early  afternoon  far  into  the night  so  that hundreds  of police  had  to  set  a  ring o f isolation around  the area  several blocks  on  either  side,  blocking all traffic in their fear of a dem onstration. Despite provocations, the assembled thousands  perm itted  no  breach  o f their  peaceful  discipline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">T he only violence was the slugging of helpless prisoners by the police  and  detectives  in  police  cars  and  vans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For many  blocks  on  either side o f Prairie and  Forty-seventh Streets  police  cars  guided  by  m embers  of the “ Red  Squad” </p>
<p class="calibre1">cruised  everywhere,  stopping  and  searching  cars,  seizing every white person in sight, chasing“suspicious” N egroesand whites  down  the  alleys,  swinging clubs  and  blackjacks  in  an organized sweep of brutality under the leadership of the “ Red S quad”  leader  Lieutenant  Mike  Mills. </p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">At various corners, Forty-seventh Street and C alum et, Forty-seventh  Street and  S outh  Park,  Forty-sixth  Street  and other places,  speakers arose to speak to crowds only to be dispersed and  seized.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">All this time the police were pushing the crowd in my direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  the  crowd was  below my  building.  Just  as they arrested  the speaker on a rooftop opposite me, I leaped up and began speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  of  the  huge  crowd  and  the  increasing  confusion  and frustration of the police, I remember speaking for ten, maybe even fifteen  minutes.  I  exhorted  the  crowd  that  they  had  the  right  to march  and  parade,  scoring  Chicago’s  Mayor  Kelly  and  Chief Allman  for  importing  Mussolini’s  tactics  into  the  Southside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  Kelly  had merited the decoration  hestowed upon him  by his  friend  Mussolini. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  1 felt a  blow on the back of my head  and spun around to face four plainclothes cops with riot clubs. They started to beat me but one said, “Careful, don’t  bloody him up.  We have to get back through  that crowd  down  there.”  They  gave  me a few kicks and dragged  me  down  the  back  stairs  outside  the  hotel.  On  the last flight,  my  spirit  rose  when  I  caught  sight  of an angry  crowd  of Blacks milling around the alley. “Look at that crowd!” exclaimed one  of the  cops  as  they  nervously  drew  their guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  big  Black  woman  in the crowd  hollered  out, “Don’t you hit him,  you  sons-of-bitches!”  The  cops  waved  their  revolvers menacingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  crowd  in  the  alley  pulled  back  grudgingly.  The  police pushed  me out the Forty-eighth Street side of the alley, commandeered  a  passing  taxi  and  ordered  the  cabbie  to  drive  to  the Wabash Avenue Station.  I remember their sighs of relief as the cab got  under  way.  They  turned  their attention  to  me,  methodically beating  my  legs  and  knees,  cursing me  with  every  blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When we arrived at the precinct station, I was flung into the bull pen,  which  was  already  filled  with  demonstrators,  all  white, excepting three or four Blacks. I received a few parting kicks as the cops  shouted,  “Here’s  Haywood,  your leader.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To one side, I could see bloodied people staggering and limping through the door. They were being herded from the patrol wagons, </p>

<p class="calibre1">forced to run through a gauntlet of club-wielding, sadistic goons, I glimpsed  a  woman  named  Anna,  our  Chicago  district  office manager,  with  blood  cascading  down  her  forehead.  A   <i class="calibre4">Chicago</i> <i class="calibre4">Defender</i> reporter witnessed  the incredible  scene: If  the  people  who  saw  the  police  break up  the  parade  were surprised  at  the brutality that  went  on  all afternoon  on 47th Street  they  would  have  been  astonished  at  the  downright savageness  w ith  which  the  police  amused  themselves  at  the W abash  Avenue  S tation.  The  patrol  wagons  gathered in  such  num bers  in  front  o f the station  to hold  up traffic on 48th  Street.  Prisoners  were  unloaded  in  the  middle  of  the thoroughfare.  On  each  side  of  the  wagon  formed  a  long double  line  o f  15-30  police.  The  unfortunate  prisoners  were pulled out of the vehicle and forced to  ru n  the gauntlet. Their heads,  shins  an d   bodies  were  clubbed  by  policemen  who yelped  in  glee  at  the  bloody  sight.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the cell,  my  legs  suddenly  fell  out  from  under  me.  It  was a delayed reaction to the beating I had received in the taxi. I could no longer  stand.  My  fellow  cell  mates  began  yelling  and  chanting, demanding  that  they  take  the  more  severely  injured  out  to  the hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally we were taken to the city hospital. Expecting some relief from  my  injuries,  I  was  greeted  by  another  hellish  scene.  The emergency  room  was  filled  with  people  injured  in  the  demonstration. The student doctors attending the injured were having a great  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,  look  at  this  one!  What  a  beaut!  Hey,  you  have to  give them cops credit, they sure know how to swing a billy.  Look here, cut  wide  open  hut  no  skull  fracture—perfect!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  given  a  quick  going-over.  I  was  unable  to walk  but  the doctor  mumbled,  “He’ll  be all  right,  now get  him out of here.” I was taken  back to  the cell  block.  By tbis time the Red Squad was busy  screening  out  the  over  500  arrested.  Two cops  were  swaggering  back  and  forth  taunting  us. “Goddamn Jews  -stirring up all  this  trouble  around  here!”  “There  oughta  be  a  Hitler  over here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  already  here,”  someone  yelled  back. </p>

<p class="calibre1">456</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">A white man with his  head in a bandage and blood stains on his shirt  was explaining, “I’m just an insurance collector,  I came over here on  my  regular rounds  and  look  what  happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy,  the Red Squad lieutenant, responded, “Oh, you don’t look so  bad, you'll be all right.  We were protecting you—wc just made  a  mistake.  They  must  have thought you  were one of those reds.  You  can  go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  there  must  have  been  a  lot  of “mistakes”  that  afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  they  finished,  only  thirty-five  of us  were  charged  with  an offense.  Late that  night,  bail  was  made  and  we were released.  A Russian comrade, a huge man,  picked me up and carried me like a baby to a  waiting car  and  then  to  my  apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  released  on  Saturday night.  In its usual flamboyant  and sensationalist  style,  the   <i class="calibre4">Chicago  Defender</i>  reported  that  I  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">“beaten so badly that he may lose the use of his legs.”6 In fact, I did h^ve to walk  on crutches for a month as a result of the scientific beating from  the  Chicago  police. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party  immediately  took  the  offensive  against  this  attack, linking it directly with the growing fascist menace abroad.  Morris Childs,  the  district  organizer,  made  a  militant  statement  to  the press in which he declared that the people of Chicago were against the “imperialist  plunder  of an  independent  country,”  and  would stand  up  for  their  right  to  say  so freely.  He  called  for  a “united people’s front against fascist reaction in this  city,”7 and urged the people of Chicago to flood the city with telegrams demanding the release  of all demonstrators  and  an  end  to police suppression of political  activity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party  called  for  a  huge  protest  meeting  the  following Wednesday  at  Boulevard  Hall  on  Forty-seventh  Street.  Despite the  Red  Squad’s  attempts  at  intimidation,  it  was  packed  with people.  Speaking to the audience from a chair, as I was unable to stand,  I  told  the  audience  that  our  demonstration  had  been  a brilliant success in showing that the people of Chicago were ready to  unite against war and fascism,  both foreign  and native,  and  in defense of their right  to speak  for  peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was indignation throughout the whole community about the  police  attack  on  our  peaceful  demonstration.  A  bi-racial</p>

<p class="calibre1">committee  of prominent  citizens,  including  Dr.  Arthur G.  Falls, chairman of the Interracial Commission; attorney Edith Sampson, who  later became a  member of the U.S.  delegation to the  United Nations; A.L. Foster, secretary of the Chicago Urban League; and Robert  Morse  Lovett  of the  University of Chicago—was formed to  investigate  the  police  brutality.  The  committee  urged  that people  send  protest  letters  and  phone calls  to  the  mayor and  to prominent  members  of the  city  administration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thirty-five of us who had been charged with inciting to riot demanded  a jury  trial.  When  we arrived  in  court,  it  was  packed with  our supporters.  The prosecutor,  on seeing the crowd,  asked for  the  trial  to  be  postponed.  During  the  following  weeks  and months  the  D.A.  asked  for  postponements  each  time  our  case came  up.  It  was  clear  that  they  were  trying  to  drag  things  out, hoping that  the  momentum  of*our  support  would  die  down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  tactic  of  theirs  imposed  a  hardship  on  us,  for  we  had thousands  of dollars tied  up in  bail which would  not  be returned until after the trial.  The money was desperately needed for defense work  elsewhere.  Finally,  we  accepted  the  deal  they  offered  of pleading  guilty  in  exchange  for  settling the  matter  quickly  and reducing the charges to disorderly conduct, thus releasing the bail money.  This went along with the understanding that the sentence would  be  a  fine of one  dollar  and  one  day  in jail,  which  we had already  served. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  NATIONAL  NEGRO  CONGRESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our campaign in defense of Ethiopia helped lay the basis for the greatest Black united front movement of the period-  the National Negro  Congress.  Founded  in Chicago in  mid-February  1936.  the Congress  brought  together  representatives  of  all  classes  in  the national  Black  community,  promoting  unity  in  the  struggle around  the  burning issues  of Black  rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  activities  on  Ethiopia  merged  with  preparations  for  the Congress. We were glad  that Chicago had been chosen as the host city  because it provided  impetus for consolidating and extending</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">our contacts and associations. The National Sponsoring Committee  for  the  Congress,  headed  by  John  P.  Davis  who  was  then secretary  of  the  Joint  Committee  on  National  Recovery,  set  up headquarters  in  Chicago.  We also established a local sponsoring committee  with  Charles  Wesley  Burton,  a  well-known  leader  in Chicago’s  Black  community,  as  chairman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  office  was  opened  on  Chicago’s  Southside.  We  set  up  a speakers’ bureau and organized canvassingteams which distributed throughout the city the congress call and thousands of copies of the pamphlet  “Let  Us  Build  the  National  Negro  Congress.”  We approached  local organizations for delegates to the congress. We were active in this preparatory work, and the result was reflected in an  extremely  large  Chicago  delegation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  congress  opened  on  Friday,  February  15,  at  the  Eighth Illinois  Regiment Armory (my old World War 1 regiment). There was  a  large  crowd  milling  around  the  entrance  as  Claude Lightfoot,  Hank Johnson  and 1  arrived,  flanked by several Black notables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  recognized  our old  Red  Squad  enemies,  Mills  and  Murphy, standing  off to the side and watching the scene.  Not  only hatred, but frustration and surprise showed on their faces. And why not? It had  been  their job to isolate and discredit us communists. Instead we  had  become  respected  members—even  leaders—in  the  Black community.  The  overwhelming  turnout  and  broad  united  front character  of the Congress were testimony to their failure.  But we were  to  learn  that  they  were  not  yet  finished  with  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The armory was jammed with over 5,000 delegates and visitors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some 585  organizations from twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia were represented, sharecroppers and tenant farmers’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">unions,  246  trade  unions,  eighty  church  and  civic organizations, youth groups,  political parties, cultural and fraternal groups, and women’s organizations. About eighty-five percent of those attending were  Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.  Philip  Randolph,  Black trade unionist and  president  of the Brotherhood  of Sleeping  Car  Porters,  gave the  keynote  address. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  linked  up the various issues in  the Black community with the need  for  a  united  front  organization.  He pointed  out  the special</p>

<p class="calibre1">CHICAGO:  AGAINST  WAR  AND  FASCISM</p>
<p class="calibre1">459</p>
<p class="calibre1">significance of developing the anti-fascist movement and the need for  special  focus  on  organizing  Blacks  in  industrial  unions.  He called  for continuing and strengthening the “fight to break down the color line in the trade unions which now have it,” He also urged independent political action in the form  of a farmer-labor party.8</p>
<p class="calibre1">John  P.  Davis,  secretary  and  a  key  organizer  of the congress, stated  its  purpose  and  outlined  the  agenda  for  the  meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greetings  of  solidarity  from  many  revolutionary  movements throughout  the  world  were  read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  one that excited  me the most  was that from  Mao Tsctung, then  provisional  chairman  of the  Chinese  Soviet  Republic.  The message read  in  part, “I greet...the First National Congress of the fighting  Negro  people,  12,000,000  strong  in  America  against every  form  of  national  and  racial  oppression.”  He  went  on  to condemn  the  fascist ^invasion  of  Ethiopia  and  add  that  “this struggle  must  spur  you  on  to  strengthen  your  ranks in  a  united fighting front, guided by the program of the militant Negro leaders which today raises its voice for a determined struggle for freedom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chairman  Mao concluded by sending greetings from Chou En-lai and  Chu  Teh.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day was devoted to panel discussions and workshops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The large armory floor was covered with groups meeting to discuss particular  issues  and  hammer out  resolutions.  The largest workshop  was on  the trade  unions,  reflecting the  significant  working class  composition  of  the  congress.  The  crucial  importance  of Southern Blacks was emphasized by Robert Wood, ILD organizer from  Birmingham,  and  by  Ozzie  Hart,  president  of  the  Sharecroppers’  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Special sessions were held on fascism and war, civil liberties and police  terror.  One  of  the  highlights  of  the  congress  was  the appearance  of  Lij  Tesfaye  Zaphiro,  special  envoy  of  Ethiopia’s London  legation,  who addressed  the  gathering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  militant  spirit  and  determination  of  the  delegates  was continually  brought  out  on  the  floor.  At  every  mention  of  the Scottsboro  Boys  and  Angelo  Herndon  there  were  prolonged cheers.  Tim  Holmes,  communist  delegate  from  New  York,  led three  cheers  for  the  defense  of  Ethiopia,  which  shook  the  vast</p>

<p class="calibre1">auditorium.  When a resolution  condemning the  Hearst press and urging its  boycott was unanimously adopted, the delegates staged a  spontaneous  demonstration  in  which  every  visible  copy  of the local Hearst sheet—the  <i class="calibre4">Herald Examiner</i>—was torn to shreds and tossed  in  the  air.  Silence  greeted the telegram from  Mayor  Kelly who  conveniently  found  that  he  had  scheduled  an  out  of  town meeting and  would  be  unable to  attend,  When  his  replacement, Judge  Burke,  telegrammed  that  he  was  suddenly  called  to  the bedside of his dying sister, the audience responded with prolonged derisive  laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  Sunday,  the  closing  session  established  the  congress  as  a permanent  organization  and  called  for  the  formation  of  local councils  throughout  the  country.  The thrust of the  program was basically  as  outlined  in  the  keynote  address  by  Randolph, centering on active support of industrial unionism and the need to combat  the  growing threat  of war and  fascism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  congress  passed  resolutions  calling  for  the  formation  of Negro  lahor  committees  to  oppose  discriminatory  practices  in trade unions and to undertake organization of unorganized Black workers.  The resolution read in part: “These Committees can be a powerful factor in the cause of Industrial Unionism and especially in mass production industry where there are many Blacks.” Other resolutions  supported  sharecroppers’  and  tenant farmers’ unions and  called  for  social  security  benefits  and  improved  unemployment  relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  front  against  war and  fascism,  the  congress  called  for increased  support  of Ethiopia,  passed  a strong resolution opposing  lynching  and  supporting  the  revised  Costigan-Wagner  Anti-Lynch  Bill  and  calling  for  continued  support  of the Scottsboro Boys  and  Angelo  Herndon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The speakers at the closing session included Norman Thomas of the Socialist  Party,  Roy  Wilkins of the NAACP, Lester Granger, chairman  of  the  Urban  League,  and  Angelo  Herndon,  who received an enthusiastic ovation.  Randolph was elected president of the  new  organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout the congress, we communists played an active role, participating on the numerous panels. James Ford stressed Black</p>

<p class="calibre1">peoples' stake in the struggle for independent political action in the form  of a farmer-labor party.  Communists  were on  the local and national  sponsoring  committees.  The  seventy-member  national council  of the National  Negro  Congress elected  at the conference included  about ten  communists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  participation  during  the  entire  three-day  session  was, however,  somewhat  hampered  by continual  harassment  from the Chicago  Red  Squad  They  set  up  a  loose  dragnet  around  the armory and jailed a number of comrades on their way to or from congress  sessions.  They  held  them  without  booking  until  the congress closed on  Sunday.  These comrades were mostly second-line  leaders.  The  police  knew  any  arrest  of a  well-known  leader would  have  provoked  largfe  demonstrations  and  protests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Red  Squad’s  disruptive  activities  were  not  confined  to harassment outside, or to just the communists. They clearly sought to  disrupt  the work  of the congress itself  Congress leaders faced daily  threats  of being thrown out of the  meeting hall.  In this,  the Red  Squad  had  an  amenable  accomplice  in  Col.  Warfield, Black  commander  of  the  Eighth  Illinois  Regiment.  He  had obviously  swallowed  whole  hog  the  Hearst  propaganda  accusations  that  the conference  was  organized  and  manipulated  by the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“reds”  and  was  part  of  the  “general  plot”  to  overthrow  the government  by  force  and  violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Col.  Warfield  had  even  escorted  friends  of  his  around  the armory,  showing them hidden  machine guns  with  stand-by crews to  back  up  any ultimatum  to clear the hall.  The colonel, whom I remember as a lieutenant during my Army days, was a “back-door relative” of Wallis Warfield.  The old Virginia slave-holding family had  recently  gained  some  notoriety  through  their  daughter’s marriage to the Duke  of Windsor. This connection had undoubtedly  been  helpful  in  the  colonel's  climb  to  eminence  in  Black bourgeois  circles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While this form of harassment failed,  Warfield and his officers were  successful  in  preventing Earl Browder from speaking at  the dosing  session.  Browder  had  been  requested  by  the  session’s chairman  to  speak,  but  was  prohibited  by  order  of  the  Eighth Regiment  officers.  This  announcement was  received  with strong</p>

<p class="calibre1">disapproval  hy  the assembled delegates.  The issue,  however,  was not  forced  hecause  it  was  the  last  session  and  just  before adjournment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In all, the conference was a huge success. All our local activities were given a real hoost, especially so in Chicago with its large turnout  at the conference.  The  Party’s prestige was also holstered and this was to be reflected in  later campaigns like the steel drive and the  electoral  campaign  of  1936. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  NINTH  PARTY  CONVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Ninth  Party Convention was held in New York City, June 24-28,  1936. The regular Party convention occupied the first three days  and  the  last  session,  held  in  Madison  Square  Garden,  was devoted to ratifying the national election platform and nominating candidates  for  the  1936  elections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  1936 elections, held in the midst of the continuing economic crisis, saw some of the most bitterly fought campaigns in American history.  The  dominant  Wall  Street  monopolists,  the  Hearst papers,  the  most  reactionary  and  fascist-minded  sections  of the ruling  class,  united  hehind  the  Alfred  M.  Landon/Col.  Frank Knox slate in a determined effort to defeat Roosevelt and reverse the  New  Deal  programs  and  gains  made  hy  the  popular  mass movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, agents of big husiness formed the Union Party which was designed to take votes away from Roosevelt and spread confusion  among  the  populist-oriented  voters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Self-declared </p>
<p class="calibre1">fascists,  Father  Coughlin  and  Gerald  L.K.  Smith,  were its  major leaders, and William Lenke was its presidential candidate. Roosts velt,  running on  a pledge to continue the New  Deal  reforms,  had substantial  middle-class  support  and  aid  from  more  liberal-minded  and  anti-fascist sections  of the  ruling class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This sharpening of contradictions in the U.S. ruling class was a reflection  of the  growing threat  of fascism on a world scale. The fascist offensive at home was part of a similar offensive abroad: the formation  of the  Hitler-Mussolini-Hirohito  axis,  the invasion  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">463</p>
<p class="calibre1">northern  China,  the  invasion  of  Ethiopia,  the  strengthening  of Hitler’s  power in Germany and the growing threat of civil war in Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order to  remain  in  the  presidency,  Roosevelt was forced to take  a  more  progressive  posture,  moving  to  the  left  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"‘economic royalists,” as he dubbed  his  opponents, and establishing a  new  alignment  of forces  in  the  ruling  circles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was in this context  that over 750 delegates met in New York for the Ninth Party Convention.  I arrived  with the large Chicago delegation  in  which  Southsiders  were  well  represented.  In  preconvention  discussions  we  had  made  a  self-critical  evaluation of our work. We pointed to our strength in united front activities and our  success  in  organizing in  the  lighter  industries.  But  our  most serious weakness lay in the work in hasic industry—steel and meat packing—where we had few contacts and had made little progress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  we  looked  forward  to  overcoming this  in  the coming period with  the opportunities  opened  up by the CIO drive for industrial unions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">William  Z.  Foster, Party chairman and  head of the trade union department,  made a  brief speech,  outlining the  objectives  of the convention  and  the  aims  of  the  Party  in  the  struggle  against reaction:  strengthen  the  mass  movements,  fight  against  fascism and war, develop our trade union work and the drive for industrial unions,  huild  our  unemployed  work  and  work  among  Blacks, youth  and  women.  He  linked  all  these  areas  together  with  the election campaign.  It  was Fosters first appearance since his  heart attack  which  had  occurred  during  the  1932  campaign.  We  were happy to see him back, anticipating his advice and participation in the  coming steel  drive.  We  gave  him  a  stirring ovation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder,  the  general  secretary,  gave  the  keynote  speech,  a report of the Central Committee. By correctly building the united front  against  fascism,  he  noted,  the  Party  had  heen  greatly strengthened.  He  stressed  that  the  Party’s  dramatic  growth--- </p>
<p class="calibre1">membership  was up sixty percent in two  years to 40,000, with an additional  11,000  YCLers—was  an  indication  of  the  growing influence  and  correctness  of our  policy.  Browder pointed  to  the progress made by the National  Negro  Congress and stressed  that</p>

<p class="calibre1">464</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">communists  had  earned  an  unchallenged  place  in  the  Black movement  through  their  efforts  around  Scottsboro  and  the Angelo  Herndon  defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  noted  that  Blacks  expected  from  communists the  greatest sensitivity,  the  greatest  energy  in  their  defense,  and  the  closest solidarity.  The  Communist  Party,  Browder  emphasized,  was proud to be spoken of as “the Party of the Negroes.” He concluded tbat the Party must  use the  1936 election campaign as a means of further  building  the  American  people’s  united  front  against fascism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder was the Party’s candidate for president; Ford again ran for vice-president.  The Party’s platform  gave implied support for Roosevelt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however,  by  focusing  on  Landon  as  the  main danger.  The platform  correctly emphasized  a minimum  program which linked demands for more jobs, for social security, relief and for Black rights,  with the key political struggle of the period—the defeat of the fascist offensive.  To carry this out, we had to build a people’s  front  in  the form  of a  farmer-labor  party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  convention  under  Browder’s  leadership  showed  the Party’s  basic strength,  it also revealed  certain rightist  tendencies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder advanced  the formulation of communism as “Twentieth Century Americanism,” a perspective which saw socialist transformation  simply  as  a  continuation  of  American  democratic  tra-ditioas.  It  was  a  classless  proposition,  which  failed  to  make distinctions  between  bourgeois  democracy  and  proletarian  democracy,  and  obscured  the  need  for  revolution.  With  hindsight, Browder’s  statements  were  actually  a  forewarning  of  what  was later to become an entire theory, the justification for dissolving the Party as a Marxist-Leninist vanguard.  In  practice it hinted at the submerging  of  the  Party  in  the  united  front,  abdicating  its independent  role  and  tailing  after  Roosevelt  and  the  New  Deal labor leaders.10</p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  time  I  doubt  that  any  of  us  understood  the  full implications  of  Browder’s  formulations.  Still,  there  was  some struggle with  Browder.  He was defeated in the Politburo when he proposed  the  Party  run  its  candidates  as  a  farmer-labor  ticket rather  than  as  communists. </p>

<p class="calibre1">CHICAGO:  AGAINST  WAR  AND  FASCISM</p>
<p class="calibre1">465</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was concerned about a tendency to downgrade the importance of the right of self-determination, Browder failed to place it as the basic  principle  upon  which  we  based  our  fight  against  Black oppression  and  for Black-white unity.  Further, it was completely absent  from  the  election  platform.  The  minimum  demands were placed,  but to the exclusion of the maximum program. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  felt this was wrong,  particularly because the large increase  in Party membership had brought in many new cadres who were not fully aware of the theoretical foundations for our position on the question.  1  made  a  speech  at  the  nominating  convention  which was  described  in  the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i>  as  follows: Harry Haywood, Negro leader in Chicago, after emphasizing that the “denial of land and the denial of freedom is at the root of  inequality,”  pledged  the  Southside  delegation  to  the carrying forward of the  Party  banner in  Chicago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  is  because  we  carry  our stand  for equality to its logical conclusion that we can lead the Negro masses,” he declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is not chance that we are the ones who spread the infamy of Scottsboro to every comer of the world. It is not chance that from our ranks  came  Angelo  Herndon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The education of Party forces to a real understanding of the Party position on the Negro question was urged by Haywood who said that “it is we who have to demonstrate in theory and practice how the struggle for self-determination is at the very heart  of the  struggle for unity of Negro and  white.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Self-determination  must  be  explained,  he  stated,  to  white workers. “Always on the basis of unity...on the basis of their common interests with the Negro people.  We must convince them  that  the  possibility  of their  own freedom  depends  on unity, and that unity demands equality in the deepest sense-self^Jetermination,”11</p>
<p class="calibre1">Back  in  Chicago,  I  was  the Communist  Party’s  candidate  for Congress  from the First Congressional District on the Southside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My opponents, both Blacks, were incumbent Congressman Mitchell,  a  Democrat  supported  by  the  Kelly  machine,  and  Republican  Oscar  DePriest.  The congressional district included the Southside  Black  wards,  In  the  campaign,  I  scored  both  of  my</p>

<p class="calibre1">adversaries for being responsible for hundreds of evictions on the Southside and I urged  my audiences to vote communist.  Following the Party’s line of indirect support for Roosevelt, I centered my main attack on Landon and his fellow Republican Oscar DePriest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mitchell  won  the  election,  part  of  the  great  pro-Roosevelt landslide  which  witnessed  the  first  nationwide  breakaway  of Blacks  from  the  Republican  Party.  The  Chicago  Democratic machine,  dominated  by  Mayor  Kelly,  rode  to  victory  on  Roosevelt’s  coattails.  I  picked  up  a  scant  899  votes  on  a  straight communist ticket.12 Though it was the highest vote ever received by the  Party  in  that  district,  it  was  still  quite  small  relative  to  our strength  for  the  Southside.  Doubtless  this  was  a  result  of  the Party’s  policy  in  the  1936 elections,  which, as  Foster uncritically remarked,  amounted  to  ‘‘objective,  but  not  official  support  for Roosevelt.”13</p>
