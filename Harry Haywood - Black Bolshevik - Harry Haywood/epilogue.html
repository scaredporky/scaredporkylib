<p class="calibre1">The  evil  system  o f  colonialism  and  imperialism  grew  up along  with  the  enslavement  of  Negroes  and  the  trade  in Negroes, and  it  will  surely  come  to its end with the thorough em ancipation  of the  black  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">M ao Tse-tung*</p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  late  fifties,  those  of  us  who  had  defended  the  revolutionary  position  on  Black  liberation  had  been driven from the CP  -either  expelled  or  forced  to  resign.  The  Party’s  leaders insisted that Blacks were well on the way to being assimilated into the  old  reliable  American “melting pot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  melting  pot  suddenly  exploded  in  their  faces.  In  the sixties,  the  Black  Revolt  surged  up  from  the  Deep  South  and quickly spread  its fury across the entire country.  Advancing wave upon  wave—with  sit-ins,  freedom  marches,  wildcat  strikes,  and, finally, hundreds of spontaneous insurrections—the Black masses announced  to  their  capitalist  masters  and  the  entire  world that  they  would  never  rest  until  their  chains  of  bondage  were completely  smashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  new  awakening  of the  Afro-American people evoked  the greatest  domestic crisis  since  the  thirties  and  it  became the focal point for the major contradictions in U.S. society, the most urgent, immediate and  pressing questions confronting the U.S. corporate rulers  and  the  revolutionary  forces.  In  its  face,  the  ruling  class employed  counter-revolutionary  dual  tactics,  both  terrorist  at</p>

<p class="calibre1">tacks on Black people, especially in the deep South, and reformist legal  maneuvers  in  Washington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First  developing as a civil rights struggle against Jim Crow, the Revolt increasingly took on a nationalist character, culminating in the  Black  Power  movement  and  projecting  into  the  heart  of modern  U.S.  society  the  demands  of  the  unfinished  democratic revolution  of the  Civil  War  and  Reconstruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a decade  of mass movement, which saw demonstrations and uprisings  in  virtually  every  ghetto  in  the  country,  the  Afro-American  people  put  all  existing programs  for Black freedom to the test.  Their  struggle  shattered  the  myth  of  peaceful  imminent integration, revealing the bankruptcy of the “Free by *63” program of the old  reformist leaders and their supporters in the revisionist CPUSA. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Black  upsurge  had  its  fueling sources  domestically  in  the combined  influences of the failure of legal democratic integration and the catastrophic deterioration of the economic position of the Black  masses,  both  absolute and  relative to whites.  In  the fifties, the further monopolization and mechanization of agriculture had precipitated  a deep agrarian  crisis,  throwing tens of thousands of rural  Blacks  off  the  land  in  the  South.  At  the  same  time,  the impending economic crisis, together with growing automation of industry, created an entire generation of ghetto youth in the urban areas,  a “lost generation”  both  north and South—with no work or prospects for work within the existing economic system.  With the dispossessed  Black  population  growing by leaps  and  bounds, the  potential  of the  movement  for  Black  Power escalated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">/T h e   Revolt  was further fueled and  inspired  by the successes  of the anti-imperialist movements of the third world, especially in the newly  independent  nations  of Africa.  This  worldwide revolution of color  broke  the  age-old  feeling of isolation  among the  Black masses.  As  Malcolm X put it, “The oppressed people of this earth make  up  a  majority,  not  a  minority.”2</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus  the  struggle  was  transformed  from  an  internal,  isolated one against  an apparently “invincible” ruling class, into a component part of a worldwide revolutionary struggle against a common imperialist enemy.  U,S,  defeats in  Korea, China, Cuba, and then, </p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vietnam, further exploded the  myth of U.S. “invincibility.’’ Many Black  Power  militants  drew  upon  the  experiences  of  the  third world  liberation  struggles  in  developing  a strategy for the movement here, as well as in many instances  openly expressingsolidarity with liberation struggles in Vietnam,  Palestine and Africa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  anti-imperialist  outlook  reflected  the  rising  mood  of the times.  Thus  the  Revolt’s  development  confirmed  our  thesis that the Black  movement would inevitably take a national-revolutionary,  anti-imperialist  direction,  culminating  in  the  demand  for political power in the areas of Black concentration. Far from being simply  a  fight  for  reforms,  as  the  revisionists  claimed,  the  Black liberation  movement  became a spark, a catalyst  pushing forward the whole working class  and  people’s  struggle  in  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  latter  point  underscored  the  treacherous  depths  of  the revisionist betrayal. The CPUSA did not even attempt to mobilize labor  support  for  the  Black  struggle,  and  the  labor  aristocracy maintained  hegemony  over the  workers’  movement.  Thus  abandoned  to  the  leadership  of  the  chauvinist  bureaucrats,  sharp divisions were sown between Black and white workers. This was in clear contrast to the unity built by communists in the thirties when the  Party  and  the  working  class  had  played  a  leading  role  in fighting for the special demands of Blacks, making the Scottsboro Boys  a  household  word from  the  tenements  of New  York to the ghettos  of Watts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though the revolutionary outlook and organization of communists never became the leading factor in the Revolt, the movement nonetheless made considerable  gains  in the course of its development.  As  1  see it, the  Revolt  developed  in  three periods.  The first began  with the  Montgomery  Bus  Boycott  of  1955-56  and  ended with  the  1963  March  on  Washington.  This  latter  protest  event brought  in  its  wake  a  widespread  disillusionment  with  the reformist, legalistic and non-violent strategy of such organizations as  SCLC,  the  Urban  League  and  the  NAACP. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  growing  isolation  of  these  “responsible”  leaders  and  the break-up  of the  Kennedy-backed  civil  rights  coalition  (the  “Big Five”—SNCC,  SCLC,  CORE,  Urban  League,  the  NAACP  and the  NAACP  Legal  Defense  and Education  Fund) ushered in the</p>

<p class="calibre1">631</p>
<p class="calibre1">second  phase of militant open  revolt This period was marked by widespread  rebellions  in  the  cities  and  the  demand  for  Black Power  But lacking a Leninist vanguard  linked to the masses, the movement  at  this  point  was  unconsolidated.  Its  nationalist leadership splintered into a variety of petty bourgeois tendencies— </p>
<p class="calibre1">separatist,  pan-Africanist,  cultural  nationalist  and  even  some terrorist  tendencies.  Thus  the  bourgeoisie was  able  to  usher  in  a third  phase  by  buying  off  the  right  wing  of  the  Black  Power movement  and  establishing  its  own  brokers  within  it.  The  1969 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black Power Conference in Newark, which was generously funded by  the  Ford  Foundation,  was  the  signal  that  this  phase  of  the movement  had  begun  in  earnest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">FROM  THE  COURTROOM  TO  THE  STREETS  (1955-63) The  stage  for  the Black Revolt  was set in  1954,  the year of the Supreme  Court  decision  outlawing  school  segregation.  This decision,  historic  in  its  effects  upon  the  future  of  the  Black movement,  was  a  tactical  concession  forced  by  the  rising  movement  at home and especially by criticism  of Jim Crow from third world  and  socialist  countries.  NAACP  leaders,  however,  hailed the  decision  as  a  vindication  of their legalistic  policies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  its  part,  the  federal  government  gave  hardcore  Southern reactionaries  the  opportunity  to  organize  and  unleash  the  most planned  and  purposeful  campaign  of anti-Black  terror  since  the defeat  of  Reconstruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  response,  the  Black  movement  in  the South  burst out from under the wraps of the old elite leadership of the NAACP and took on  a  mass  character—defying  segregation  laws  and  directly attacking  the  Jim  Crow  system.  The  spark  was  ignited  in  the Montgomery, Alabama, Bus Boycott of 1955-56 under the leadership  of  Martin  Luther  King.  The  flames  spread.  In  1960,  the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) began sitin  demonstrations  which  swept  the  South. </p>

<p class="calibre1">support for their campaign to integrate transportation facilities. In the spring of 1963, the struggle reached a high point in the Battle of Birmingham and  from there  leaped over regional boundaries and spread  throughout the country,  uniting various classes and strata of  Black  people  under  the slogan  of “Freedom  Now”! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  movement  exerted  tremendous  attractive  power  on  all sections  of the  population, especially  the  youth,  drawing sections of  the  white  community  into  support  and  participation.  The summer  of  1964  saw  hundreds  of  college  students  travel  to Mississippi to  participate  in  a  voter  registration  project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also  in the South that the armed  self-defense movement was  initiated  in  North  Carolina  by  Robert  Williams,  whose NAACP  local  was  suspended  for  these  activities.  Based  upon Black  workers  and  war  veterans,  other  armed  groups  like  the Deacons for Defense and Justice in Louisiana and Mississippi won important victories against the Ku Klux Klan in the mid-sixties. It was  during  the  Meredith  March  through  Mississippi,  which was protected  by  the  Deacons,  that  the  slogan  of  Black  Power first gained  national  prominence  in  1966. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Chairman  Mao  wrote,  the  movement  became </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ a  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">clarion call to all the exploited and oppressed people of the United States  to  fight  against  the  barbarous  rule  of  the  monopoly capitalist  class.”3  Movements  developed  among  students  and women,  Chicano,  Native  American and  Puerto  Rican people,  as well  as  among  activists  against  the  Vietnam  War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alarm  bordering  on  panic  struck  the  ruling  circles.  <i class="calibre4">Time</i> magazine  expressed  the  fear  that  the  civil  rights  movement </p>
<p class="calibre1">“will  crash  beyond  the  framework  of  passive  resistance  into new dangerous dimensions.”4  U.S.  efforts to build a neo-colonial empire  in  the third  world were further impaired as the grotesque contrast  between  its  high-flown  moral  posture  and  the  brutal reality of an organized system of racist barbarism nurtured within its own borders was further exposed.  Racist police employing such methods  as  electric  prodding  irons,  police  dogs,  high  pressure hoses  and  the  hrutal  beating of women,  provoked angry  outrage throughout  the  world.  Its  impact  was  especially  felt  in  Africa, where concern about racism in the United States was expressed by</p>

<p class="calibre1">I he  Addis  Ababa  Conference  of African  Ministers.3</p>
<p class="calibre1">The alarm  of white  ruling circles was  also reflected among the lop  leadership of the NAACP and  other reformist organizations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  maintain their  role as “honest”  brokers  between  the black  masses  and the white rulers, they  had  been forced to grant Home  autonomy  to  the  Southern  dissident  wing led  by  King and SCLC.  Representing  ministers  and  the  Black  bourgeoisie  of the South, King favored a policy of non-violent, mass action. But he in turn  was  faced  with  a  growing  challenge from  the  more  radical elements of the movement, especially the youth of SNCC, sections of CORE and the N AACP youth—the shock troops of the Revolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">II  was  among  these  front-line  fighters  that  the  inherent  conflict between King’s non-violent philosophy and direct mass action first came  to  a  head.  Under  conditions  prevailing in the Deep South, direct mass action and civil disobedience campaigns could develop niul grow only if accompanied by organized armed self-defense. In renouncing  self-defense,  the  movement  inevitably  reached  an impasse there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  situations  like the heroic  but  unsuccessful  battle of Albany, Georgia,  the  moral  and  political  bankruptcy  of  making  nonviolence  a  principle  was  revealed.  In Jackson,  Mississippi,  even idler  the  assassination  of NAACP  leader  Medgar  Evers,  little or tm  progress' was  made.  Similarly  in Greensboro, North Carolina, 2,000  demonstrators  were  jailed  over  the  integration  of  two restaurants.  And  in  Birmingham,  the  South’s  most  important bastion  of white  supremacy,  it  was  fourteen  years  until  a  token Indictment  was  brought  against  a  few  of  the  child-murdering bombers.  The  upsurge  of  1963  resulted  in  gains in  other  parts of the  country,  but  practically  none  in  the  Deep  South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  the  victories  that  were  won  in  desegregation  and  legal reforms  produced  no improvement  in  the conditions of poor and working Blacks.  In the fifteen-year period between  1949 and 1964, I he  median annual income for non-white families increased from $1,650  to  $3,800,  while  the  median  income  for  white  families Increased from $3,200to more than $6,800 during the same period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The disparity between white and non-white annual income in 1949 </p>
<p class="calibre1">hud been less than $1,600.  By  1964,  the gap was morethan $3,000. </p>

<p class="calibre1">634</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the economic crisis of 1958-64,  the government  admitted that Black unemployment was above the 10% mark and the Black-white ratio of unemployment rate was boosted  from 1.6 in  1948 to 2  or 2.5  from the early fifties on.  Black youth  were  hardest  hit  of all.  Between  the  two  “good”  years  of  1957  and  1964,  their unemployment  increased  51%,  at  the same  time  that  one  out  of every  six young Blacks was driven  out  of the official  labor force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These experiences cast doubt on the whole program of “peaceful democratic integration.” Riding the tiger of the Black Revolt, King and  fellow  advocates  of non-violence  were rescued  by  President Kennedy.  Trying  to  walk  a  tightrope  between  the  hardcore dixiecrat defiance and surging Black militancy, the administration sought  to divert  the mass  movement  back into legalistic channels by  proposing a civil rights bill.  The bill’s declared purpose was to get the Black movement off the street and back into the courtroom where  the  100  years  of  litigation  promised  by  the  Southern governors could proceed.  Instead of the militant protest originally planned,  the  1963  March  on  Washington  was  converted  into  a peaceful  demonstration  in  support  of the  President’s  civil  rights bill.  But  even  this  much-vaunted  march  could  not  succeed  in diverting  the  rising  tide  of  rebellion.  It  did,  however,  openly expose to the masses the  collusion  between the  Kennedy  Administration and  men like Whitney Young of the Urban League, Roy Wilkins of theNAACPand A. Philip Randolph. At the same time, the  march  leaders  censored  John  Lewis’s  speech  for  SNCC  because  it  attacked  Kennedy’s  Civil  Rights  Bill.6</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malcolm  X showed  how the government  used  bribery to bring these  reformist  leaders  to  its  aid  in  controlling  the  masses  in March  on  Washington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  they [the adm inistration-ed.] found out that this black steam roller  was  going  to  come  dow n  on  the  capital,  they called  in Wilkins, they called in R andolph, they called in these national Negro leaders that you respect and told th em ,“Call it off.” Kennedy said, “Look, you all are lettingthis thing go too far.” And Old Tom  said, * Boss, 1 can’t stop it, because I  didn’t start  it.”  Pm  telling  you  what  they said.

<p class="calibre1">BLACK POWER</p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  this  event,  mass  rejection  of  peaceful  democratic integration  became  apparent  in  the  growing  wave  of  ghetto rebellions,  'Hiere  were  twenty-four  in  1964,  thirty-eight  in  1966, one  hundred  twenty-eight  in  1967 and one hundred thirty-one in the  first  half of  1968,  the  year  of King’s  assassination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These urban uprisings put into sharp focus the alienation of the Black  masses from the old-line leaders like Roy Wilkins, A. Philip Randolph  and  Bayard  Rustin.  As  the  Kerner  Report  lamented, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Those  who  come  forward  to  discourage  rioting  may  have  no influence with the rioters.” The report also contained another ploy of the  bourgeoisie, designed to get itself off the  hook.  It charged: </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  white  Americans  have  never  understood—but  what  the Negro can never forget— is that white society is deeply implicated in  the  ghetto.  White  institutions  created  it,  white  institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.”* By blaming everyone, including  the  masses  of white working people, the ruling class in effect  blamed  no  one  and  covered  up  their  own  crimes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  Power  became the rallying cry of the uprisings because it summed up the main lessons learned by the masses during the civil rights  phase  of the movement; legal rights meant nothing without the  political  power  to enforce  them.  Black  Power  expressed  the growing consciousness of the Afro-American masses that they are an  oppressed  nation  whose  road  to  freedom  and  equality  lies through taking political  power into their own hands.  Thus Blacks should  become  the  controlling  force  in  the  areas  of their  major concentration— in  the  urban  ghettos  of  the  north  as  well  as  the Black  Belt  area  of the  South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  emergence  of  Black  Power  as  a  mass  slogan  signaled  a fundamental  turning  point  in  the  modern  Afro-American  liber</p>

<p class="calibre1">ation  struggle,  carrying  it  to  the  threshold  of  a  new  phase.  It marked  a  basic  shift  in  content  and  direction  of the  movement, from  civil  rights  to  national  liberation,  with  a  corresponding realignment of social forces. It indicated that the Black Revolt had crashed  beyond  the  limited  goals  set  by  the  old-guard  reformist assimilationist  leadership  of the NAACP and  associates,  beyond the  strictures  of Reverend  King’s  non-violent  holding operation, into  channels  leading  to  direct  confrontation  with  the  main enemy-  the  “white  power”  oligarchy  of the  imperialists.  Inevitably, this struggle moved towards juncture with the anti-imperialist  revolutions  in  the  third  world  and  with  the  working  class movement  for  socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vehicle of the Revolt  was an indigenous grassroots nationalism,  upsurging from  the poor and  working masses of the urban ghettos and  the poor and dispossessed farmers and sharecroppers of the  Black  Belt.  The movement reflected their strivings to break out  of  the  bind  of  racist  economic  and  cultural  subjugation,  to establish  for  themselves  the  dignity  of  a  free  and  equal  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here was the mass base of SNCC, the Black Panther Party (which raised the question of armed self-defense for the urban ghettos and popularized  the  writings of Mao Tsetung),  Malcolm  X  (recently split  from  the  Black  Muslims),  and  other  revolutionary  nationalists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afro-Americans  were  caught  up  in  an  assertive  drive  for  a viable,  collective  identity  adapted  to  the  peculiar  conditions  of their  development  in  the  U  S.  and  their  African  background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, it was a drive to recover a cultural heritage shaped by over 300  years  of  chattel  slavery  and  a  century  of thwarted  freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  quest for identity as a people in its own right led ever greater segments  of  the  Afro-American  community  to  a  fundamental reassessment of their actual status as an oppressed nation  -virtual captives  in the metropolitan heartland  of one of the world’s most powerful  and  predatory  imperialist  powers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A growing body of young Black radical intellectuals assumed an active  role  in  fostering  Black  Power  nationalism.  Their  efforts, reflecting  the  spirit  of  the  masses,  produced  a  new  cultural renaissance surpassing that  of the twenties.  The vanguard was an</p>

<p class="calibre1">angry,  alienated  Black  youth--a  proud  and  sensitive  young generation  which  refused  to  stagnate  and  die  in  a system  which sought  to  destroy  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  above  developments  led  to  a  mass  defection  from  the old guard leadership which became morally and politically isolated from  the  masses.  The  trend  of  Black  Power  nationalism  rose  to dominate the Black community in the second phase of the struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The nationalism of the sixties differed from the Garvey movement and  its  latter-day  spiritual  descendants,  the  Black  Muslims, neo-Garveyites  and  others.  In  the  main,  the  Black  Power  movement called not for escapist withdrawal, but for a fight  here where Blacks  live.  Among some  narrow  nationalist  sects,  however,  the old  backward  utopianism  persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  leadership  of the  Black  Power  movement, while having a profound and positive effect on the struggles of the Black masses... </p>
<p class="calibre1">displayed  its  own  major weakness—that of being primarily based in  the  Black intelligentsia and  petty-bourgeoisie. This was inevitable  in  the  face  of the  CPUSA’s  defection.  The  movement  was hamstrung  in  attempting  to  fight  U.S.  imperialism  without  the benefit  of  a  program  of  class  struggle.  It  also  deeply  underestimated the potential strength of unity with the overall workers’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">movement  in  achieving the  goals  of the  national struggle.  These weaknesses  contributed  to  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  corporate establishment  to  temporarily  cool  out  and  buy  off  the  Black upsurge  by  employing  both  reformist  and  narrow  nationalist schemes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  first  Black  Power  activists  submerged  class  conflicts in the movement.  But soon a right wing emerged, with its base in a sector of the  ghetto  bourgeoisie:  businessmen,  ministers,  professionals, poverty  project  leaders,  Black  studies  professors,  newly-hired lower management and token upper management. This right wing found  its  spokesmen  in  elite  intellectuals  like  Roy  Innis,  Floyd McKissick  and  Harold  Cruse.  They  aspired  to  the  role  of economic  and  political  administrators  of a  Black  “internal  colony,”  still  owned  and  controlled  by  white  monopoly  capitalism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">COOPTING  A  RIGHT  WING</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  perspective  of  pursuing  the  Black  bourgeoisie's  class interests  within an imperialist  framework was not fundamentally different  from  the  integrationism  of the old guard Black  leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  more  nimble  members  of this  group  hopped  on  the  bandwagon,  while  others,  like  Whitney  Young,  kept  a  foot  in  both camps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  emerging  Black  right  wing  was  met  half way  by  a  white establishment  in search  of new allies.  Facing defeats  abroad and burning  cities  at  home,  the  establishment  was  haunted  by  the specter  of  a  national  rebellion  in  its  urban  nerve  centers.  As McGeorge Bundy pointed out, if blacks bum the cities, “the white man's  companies  will  have to  take  the  losses."9</p>
<p class="calibre1">This new kind of broker spoke the language of the Black Power movement and  might  better lead it  into safe channels, away from the  confrontations  which  threatened  domestic  tranquility  and international  credibility,  So  the  buffer  zone  between  the  establishment  and  the  Black  masses  was extended  to  include  the new right-wing  nationalists  and  their  social  base.  A  wide  range  of corporate  leaders  united  behind  this  strategy,  bringing into  play their  tremendous  powers  of cooptation  and  manipulation.  This does  not  mean  that  the  bourgeoisie  gave  up  on  the  old-line leadership,  but  rather  that  they  concentrated  their efforts on the right-wing  nationalists  in  this  particular  period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bundy’s Ford  Foundation led the way, putting some of CORE’S </p>

<p class="calibre1">Harvard’s  Kennedy  Institute  of  Politics  defined  self-determination  to  mean  community  development  corporations  and  tax incentives  for  investors  in  the  ghetto;  Roy  Innis  endorsed  this formula. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifty  corporations  jointly  sponsored  two  Black  Power  Conferences  under  Nathan  Wright’s  leadership.  To  Wright,  Black Power  meant  Black  capitalism,  or,  as he expressed  it,  “The most strategic opportunity which our American capitalistic system has</p>

<p class="calibre1">to  preserve  or  strengthen  itself lies  in the possibility of providing the Negro community with both a substantial and immediate stake in  its  operation  at  every  level.” 10</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  “Black  capitalism”  was  the  centerpiece  of  the  power elite’s  strategy.  This  included  a  stepped-up  policy  of  piecemeal concessions  to  contain  and  reverse  the  revolutionary  trend  by buying up and corrupting potential and actual community leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard Nixon articulated this strategy in 1968: “What most of the militants are asking is not separation but to be included in—not as supplicants,  but  as  owners,  as  entrepreneurs-  to  have a  share of the  wealth  and  a  piece  of  the  action.” 11  Sections  of the  ghetto entrepreneurs  and  professionals  were  ready  to  misuse  the  collective  strength  of  the  Black  community  to  get  a  “piece  of  the action.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crisis and ebbing of the Black Power nationalist movement was  precipitated  by  the  rise  of  this  thoroughly  reformist  trend, which was backed directly by the imperialists. This new Black elite moved  systematically  to  take  over  the  movement,  sap  its  revolutionary  potential  and  restrict  it  to  goals which  U.S.  capitalism was  willing  to  concede.  In  this,  they  were  aided  by  a  growing apparatus  of repression—police,  FBI,  CIA, National  Guard and Army Intelligence  -which murdered, jailed and suppressed  many un-cooperative leaders.  This came on the heels of Nixon’s law and order, white backlash campaign of 1968. The full story of intrigue, murder,  character assassination,  splittism and  provocative activities  is  only  now beginning to  come to  light.  The exposure of the FBI’s  notorious COINTELPRO operations was but the tip of the iceberg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where were the forces to give leadership to the movement in the face  of this  both  open  and  covert  assault  by the  imperialists? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly they were not to be found in the CPUSA which made every  effort  to  attack  and  downgrade  the  movement.  James Jackson  summed  up  the  basic  attitude  of  the  CPUSA  toward nationalism  in  a  recent  article.  “The  main  function  of  nationalism,” he wrote,  <i class="calibre4">“whatever its form</i> (our emphasis),  is to split and divide  and  fragment  the  international  working  class  and  the advanced  contingents  of the  national  liberation  movements.”12</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Genuine  communists,  of  course,  must  distinguish  between  the nationalism of the oppressor nations and that of the oppressed, as well as between  nationalism’s progressive and backward  aspects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without  the  leadership  of  a  genuine  communist  party,  the limitations  of the  nationalist  outlook (as  I  have  already  shown) became clear. Its leadership was unable to make a class analysis of the Black  community,  thus overestimating the unity between the Black  masses  and  the  Black  bourgeoisie,  while  underestimating the need  for  unity  with  the general  workers’  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, the upsurge spurred the political development of the Black  proletariat,  building on the  foundations  laid  by the  Black caucus  movement  of the  post  World  War  11  period.  Beginning in  the  early  sixties,  a  new  wave  of  Black  caucuses  sprung up  in  basic  industries  across  the  country,  reaching  perhaps their  highest  political  development  in  the  Detroit  League  of Revolutionary  Black  Workers.  But,  in  the  final  analysis,  the treachery of the Dennis-Hall clique prevented Black workers and the  working  class  as  a  whole  from  playing  a  consistently  independent  and  leading  role  as  a  class  force  during  this  period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that  if we had  had a revolutionary party  in the sixties that  much  of the  spontaneity and reactionary nationalism of the period could have  been combatted.  Undoubtedly, the ruling class would still have tried to split the Black Power movement, but the left  wing  would  not  have  been  nearly  wiped  out as an  organized force  in  the  Black  community.  If the  CPUSA  hadn’t  liquidated communist  work  in  the  South  and  in  the  factories,  the  sixties would  have  seen  a  consolidated  proletarian  force  emerge in  the Black Belt and the ghettos. The communist forces could have come out of the Revolt with developed cadres rooted in the factories and communities,  with  credibility  among the  masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  ROAD  AHEAD</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  such  shortcomings,  the  sixties  Revolt  did  force  concessions from the ruling class—breaking down a great deal of legal and  occupational Jim Crow, enlarging the Black middle class and</p>

<p class="calibre1">extending  the franchise to  Blacks  in the South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  have  these  gains exhausted  the  revolutionary  potential  of the  Black  movement?  Have  the  mechanization  of  Southern agriculture,  massive  outmigrations  from  the  Black  Belt  and civil rights  laws  wiped  out  the  consequences  of  the  old  plantation system?  Most  important,  have  these  changes  wiped  out  the existence  of an  oppressed  Black  nation  in  the  Deep  South  as  so many have claimed? Is the right of self-determination for the Black Belt  nation  still a  demand  that  communists  should  raise? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s  take a look at current  conditions.  Despite  the imperialist offensive against the  Black  masses, which  resulted in tremendous outmigrations  from  the  Black  Belt  homeland,  there  remains  a stable  community  of  Black  people  in  the  rural  South  and  a growing Black population  in  the urban  areas.  The actual number of  Blacks  has  steadily  increased.  In  1940,  there  were  over  nine million  Black  people in the  South  and  by  1970  the number had increased to nearly twelve million. Over 70% of all Black people in the U.S.  were born in the South and still have roots there. Within the Black Belt territory itself, despite fierce economic and political coercion,  there  has  remained  since  1930  a  stable  community  of over  five  million.  The  “escape  valve’’  into  the  northern  cities  is being closed  by  the  crisis,  and  outmigration  from  the  South  has slowed  considerably  with  reverse  migration  now  becoming  the dominant  trend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  no accident that the civil rights movement first arose in the South  where  Blacks  face the  most  terroristic oppression and  are often  denied  even  the  most  basic democratic  rights.  In  fact,  the mechanization of agriculture, which drove so many Blacks off the land  in the South, provided one of the main fueling sources of the rebellion.  SNCC  did  some  of its  best  work  in  its  Southern rural projects,  where  it  took  up the struggles of sharecroppers and  the displaced  peasantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today the spiraling inflation and recession of the worst crisis in forty years still  hits Blacks  hardest, the victims  of continued last-hired,  first-fired  policies and  an  unemployment rate twice that  of whites.  Recent  statistics  show  the  highest  rate of unemployment among  Black youth  since  World  War II,  while at  the same time</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK.  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">there  have  been  cutbacks  in  Black  studies  and  other affirmative action  programs.  The  result  is  yet  another  “lost”  generation  of Black  youth  condemned  to  the  margins  of the  workforce.  Once again, the sensitive ghetto youth and students are becoming a flash point  for  all  the  contradictions  of the system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of the biggest strike wave in twenty years, the ruling class  is desperately trying to  exacerbate existing race differences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  accounts  for  the  new  rise  of anti-busing and  segregationist movements  in  northern  cities,  the  rise  in  membership  of the  Ku Klux  Klan  and  the  increasing  attacks  on  social  welfare  and affirmative  action  programs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  crisis  is  also  undermining  the  existence  of the  expanded Black  middle class which was created by the ruling class’s strategy of concessions  during  the  “boom”  years  of the  sixties.  Business failures  and  service  cutbacks  are  weakening  this  group  economically,  while fascist attacks and growing class divisions inside the  Black community are eroding the political credibility of Black elected  officials.  In cities like Atlanta, Detroit and Newark, where Black mayors have been elected, the living and working conditions among Blacks  have continued to deteriorate.  Far from indicating the attainment  of real  political  power for Afro-Americans,  these politicians  have been elected merely to serve as administrators for the  white  power  structure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  domestic  situation  is  combined  with  an  international situation  more  explosive than  in  the  sixties, symbolized  particularly  by  the fierce  liberation  struggles  in southern  Africa and the increasing threat  of war between the two superpowers.  It is only a matter of time before the smouldering embers of Black Revolt burst into  flame  again.  As  Lenin  pointed  out,  “Capitalism  is  not  so harmoniously  built  that  the  various  sources  of  rebellion  can immediately  merge  of  their  own  accord,  without  reverses  and defeats.” 13  Whenever the  next  Black upsurge comes—whether as part  of  a  general  revolutionary  upsurge  or  as  signal  of  the movement  to  come—we  must  be  prepared  to  bring  out  mass support for  equality and self-determination as a special feature of the struggle for  socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most assuredly, the next wave of mass struggle will begin from a</p>

<p class="calibre1">higher  level  of  consciousness,  based  on  what  the  last  upsurge taught  the  masses about the nature of the enemy and the path to liberation.  In  fact,  the  Revolt  sparked  an  irreversible  growth  of Black  national consciousness  and  brought  forward  a  new  generation of revolutionaries.  A section of this movement  has turned to the  best  experiences  of  the  socialist  countries  in  fighting  for equality  of  nations  and  nationalities.  These  young fighters  have become part  of the growing body of cadres of the anti-revisionist communist  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  this  regard,  a great deal  has  been  learned from the  People’s Republic of China, its Communist Party and its great leader, Mao Tsetung.  The  emphasis  on  testing  ideas  in  practice,  care  and flexibility  in  applying  united  front  tactics,  of  relying  upon  and serving  the  people,  realism  in  dealing  with  power  relationships, respect for the integrity of national minorities and for the rights of the  third  world  nations  against  great  nation  chauvinism,  the concrete analysis and application of Marxist-Leninist principles to one’s  own  country,  and  the  pursuing  of  the  two-line  political struggle  inside  the  Party are all part of China’s great  legacy.  For me,  this  has  been  a  cause  for  great  optimism  for  the  future, especially  for  the  new  generation  of communists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This generation, left without guideposts after the hetrayal of the CP,  was forced  to  start  almost from scratch.  It  has  carried  out  a long march  through the mass struggles of the sixties, to recapture our revolutionary  heritage.  It  is  heartening that they,  along with some  of  us  veteran  fighters,  are  building  a  genuine  communist party—the  first  in  this  country  in  decades.  To  this  new  revolutionary  movement  falls  the  task  of  giving  leadership  in  the coming  upsurge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ever  deepening  crisis  and  the  increased  threat  of  war between the two superpowers are affecting the living conditions of the broad masses of American people. At the same time, the ability of the  imperialists  and the labor aristocracy to grant  concessions and  thus  buy  off  dissent,  has  been  somewhat  hampered  by  the crisis.  Under  such  conditions  and  with  the  leadership  of  a  new party, there is a strong possibility of building a movement based on lhe  alliance  between  Blacks  and  other  nationalities  and  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">working class.  As  Chairman  Mao  wrote  in  1968: The struggle of the black people in the United States is bound to  merge  with  the  American  workers’  movement,  and  this will  eventually  end  the  criminal  rule of the  U.S.  monopoly capitalist  class.14</p>
