<p class="calibre1">Chapter  21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A  Party  Weakened</b> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">from  Within</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  morning after  the  November  1948  election,  the  Party’s house  of cards  was  already  beginning  to  collapse.  In  a  surprise upset over Republican Thomas E.  Dewey, Truman was re-elected president,  with Henry Wallace receiving a scant million votes. The illusions most Party leaders had  held of launching a third party on firm  foundations  of farm-labor support  were smashed,  reflecting our  gross  overestimation  of the  whole  Progressive  Party  movement.  I  and  many  of  my  friends  wondered  then  what  would happen  to  the  leadership’s  designs  for the  grand  coalition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was in an atmosphere of increasing isolation and a rising red scare  that  the  Party  prepared  for the  trial  of the eleven  indicted leaders which began in January  1949.  Since the end of the war, the government  had  been  winding  up the  machinery  for a  full  scale attack  on the left. The Smith Act, which had been passed in 1940, was  now  being  fully  enforced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing full well that the Party still had strong roots among the masses, the cold war offensive became U.S. imperialism’s response to  the  growing  trend  of  world  revolution.  Imperialism  emerged from  World War II in a greatly weakened position, as the Eastern European countries joined  the socialist  camp and  popular movements  swept  the  developing  countries.  “The  popular  forces  of revolution  were  on  the march in all countries without exception, Asia,  Africa,  Latin  America and the  West Indies,” said R. Palme D utt.1  The  breach  in  the  structure  of  world  imperialism  was</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">571</p>
<p class="calibre1">widened  by  the  emergence  of  socialist  countries  in  eastern Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But most important, from the standpoint of its effect on colonial people, was the victory of the Chinese Revolution. The success of the  national  and  socialist  revolutions  in  China  extended  the world’s socialist sector to one-tbird of humanity, transforming the balance  of  world  forces  in  favor  of the  camp  of  socialism  and national liberation, giving sweeping impetus to the anti-imperialist revolution.  It  was  through  this  widening  breach  that  the  revolutionary  movements  of the third  world  surged  toward  political independence  and  the  establishment  of  new  sovereign  states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Objectively  speaking,  these  developments  could  have  greatly strengthened  our  position  in  the  fight  against  the  government’s anti-communist  offensive. The  Party should have boldly opposed this  assault  and  done  broad  propaganda  and  agitation  on  the source  of  these  attacks.  Instead,  the  right-wingers  chose  the defeatist  policy  of furthering  our  retreat  from  the  masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally,  I  often found  myself being trailed  by FBI  agents.  I couldn’t  get  a  job  and  found  it  difficult  renting  a  place  to  live without  the  FBI  intervening.  I  remember my wife threatening to call  the  health  inspector  on  one  of our slum  landlords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mrs.  Hall,”  he  said  slyly,  “I  care about  the  health  inspectors about  as  much as your  husband  cares about  the  FBI.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scores of communists and  activists in the labor movement, the Black  movement  and  various  anti-fascist committees were arrested, indicted or brought before Congressional and Senate committees to testify.2 It was the era of deportations, theTaft-Hartley anti-labor  law,  the  loyalty  oath  and  blacklists.3  Gerhart  Eisler,  a German who  had been a Comintern rep to the U.S, in the thirties and a good friend of mine, was arrested and deported as a “master spy,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A group of ten Hollywood producers, directors and writers were blacklisted for their supposed communist  leanings and served jail sentences for refusing to testify before HU AC. Eugene Dennis was convicted  of contempt  of Congress  in  June  1947  for  refusing to testify. Bill Patterson was charged with contempt of Congress after being  called  a  “nigger  son-of-a-bitch”  in  a  Senate  hearing  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p594"></a><img src="index-594_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">572</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouting "You’re  another son-of-a-bitch!"  in  response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pat  and  I  were  good  friends  at  the  time  and  also  did  some political work together.  One day in the summer of 1948, he called me up on the phone, "Come on over here, Harry, there’s somebody I’d  like  you  to  meet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  went  around  the  corner  to  the  building  where  he  lived  and walked up to the apartment. Sitting there was Haywood Patterson, one  of the  few  remaining  Scottsboro  frame-up  victims  who  had not  been  paroled.  He  had  just  escaped  from  Kilby  Prison.  I recognized  him  right  away  because  he  looked  like  his  mother, whom  I  had  met  in  Chattanooga.  He  was  a  handsome  young man-  about  thirty-three at the time, well built and above average in  height—but  his most  outstanding feature was his big luminous eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson  told us the harrowing story of his prison escape and about  his  experiences  while  in  prison.  As  we  sat  there  talking, somebody,  1  don’t  remember who, got the  idea that it would be a good  thing  to  get  young  Patterson’s  story  down  on  paper.  Pat then  suggested  that  we call  Earl  Conrad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 thought this was a fine idea. I knew Conrad and thought a lot of his work.  As a young white man, he had done a good bit of writing about  the  Black  liberation  struggle,  even  written  for some Black newspapers,  and  enjoyed  wide  respect  among  the  masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conrad  came over to the apartment and immediately agreed to work  on the book.  He took Haywood with  him to  his apartment and,  in  two  weeks,  they  wrote  the  story  of  <i class="calibre4">Scottsboro  Boy. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Haywood Patterson later went to Detroit to stay with his sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Civil  Rights  Congress  initiated  a  campaign  to  stop  his extradition,  and  Michigan’s  Governor G.  Mennen  (Soapy)  Williams  refused  to  sign the extradition  papers,  saying that the  man could  not  get  a  fair  trial  in  Alabama.  Unfortunately,  Haywood Patterson  was  soon  after convicted of a murder resulting from a barroom  brawl.  He was to  remain in  prison until he died in  1959. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In January  1949,1 was looking for a way to make some money and thought about sailing again, 1 wondered whether I would still be able to  get  on a ship, since communists were being screened by the  Coast  Guard.  But  I  was lucky.  They didn’t  seem to  know  me</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p595"></a><img src="index-595_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">573</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  1  was  able  to  get  a  Coast  Guard  pass.  1  signed  on  my  old wartime ship, the Moore-McCormack liner   <i class="calibre4">Uruguay</i>, for a thirty-eight day cruise to Buenos Aires as a waiter.  It was my last voyage as  an  NMU  seaman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As far as the crew was concerned,  it was a different  ball game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Curranites were firmly entrenched by this time and dominated the ship. It was the first time 1 had sailed under such conditions and only  knew a  few old  shipmates  who hadn’t yet been screened out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congressman  Bob  LaFollette,  Jr.,  a  progressive  of  the  llcnry Wallace  type,  was  a passenger on  that  cruise  and  was  invited to speak  to  us.  I  guess  it  was a sign of the times that a man of such liberal reputation delivered as vicious an all-out attack on reds as he did  on that  occasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I pretty much kept to myself on the trip. It was a pleasant though uneventful voyage, the first time I had been in South America. We stopped  in  Trinidad,  curved  out  around  the  coast  of  Brazil  to Bahia,  a  city  rich in the early  history and culture of the Africans brought over as slaves. Then on to Rio dc Janeiro, Santos (the port of Sao  Paolo),  Montevideo,  and  finally  Buenos  Aires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On returning to New York, I was assigned to do research for the defense in the trial of the eleven communist  leaders. I was glad to get the assignment, glad to be doing some Party work for a change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My job  was  to  help  Benjamin  Davis  and  Robert  Thompson  in preparation for their depositions  and to  anticipate questions that might  be asked by the prosecution.  Wc worked closely with their attorney,  Harry  Sacher,  a  very  energetic  and  bright  guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the  other defendants, Thompson and Davis were charged under the Smith  Act with conspiring to organize the CPUSA, "a society,  group,  and assembly  of persons  who teach and advocate the  overthrow  and  destruction  of the  Government  of the  United States  of  America  by  forces  and  violence,  and  knowingly  and willfully  to  advocate  the  overthrow  and  destruction  of  the Government  of  the  United  States  by  force  and violence.” 4  The other major charge was that of liquidating the CPA and conspiring to  reorganize the  CPUSA. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob Thompson was a war hero who had fought in Spain and in New Guinea during World War II, where he won the Distinguished</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p596"></a><img src="index-596_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">574</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK.  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Service Cross.  At the time of his indictment, he was one of Foster’s prot£g6s  and  was  secretary  of  the  New  York  District.  He  was eventually  sentenced  to  three  years and,  while in jail, was beaten severely by a fascist thug.  He never fully recovered from the head wound  he  received  as  a result. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ben  Davis  was  by  that  time a  member  of the  New  York  City Council  and  the  leading Black  in  the  Party.  He  was  a  long-time acquaintance  of mine,  as 1  have  already  mentioned,  and  we  had developed  considerable  political differences  over the  years.  I was nevertheless  pleased  to  be working  on  his  defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was at this time that I met George Crockett, a young and very idealistic Black attorney from Detroit. (Today he is a judge in that city.) I think so me of his illusions about bourgeois democracy were lost  at this trial. He was once moved to tears of amazement at one of the more crude and arbitrary rulings of Judge Medina. Crockett spent  thirty  days  in  jail  for  contempt,  along  with  the  other attorneys in the case:  Sacher, Abraham Isscrman, Louis McCabe and  Richard  Gladstein. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  trial,  which  was  held  at  the  Federal  Courthouse  in Foley Square  in  New  York,  lasted  nine  months.  From the start,  it was clearly not a trial, but an inquisition of the Communist Party. The press  willingly  colluded  with  the  government  attack  and  the outcome  of the  case was a foregone  conclusion.  Presiding at  this mockery  of  justice  was  the  eminent  jurist,  millionaire  and landlord—Judge  Harold  Medina.  I  went to the courtroom every day  and  sat  through  the  interminable,  boring sessions.  I saw the viciousness and red-baiting of Medina and the prosecutor, Francis McGohey,  first  hand,  as  well  as  the  unseemly  array  of  stool pigeons the  government had mustered to its side.  Much  has been said and written about this trial, and I will not go into much more detail  here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was significant in that it was  here that the theory of peaceful transition to socialism was first put forward as Party policy,5 The defense  had  two  choices in terms  of a legal  strategy for this trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  offensive strategy would have  meant  proclaiming the right to advocate revolution, to stand firmly  on  the  First  Amendment, to make the courtroom a tribune of the people as Dimitrov had done</p>

<p class="calibre1">575</p>
<p class="calibre1">when the Nazis charged him with burning the Reichstag in 1933. A defensive  line  would  have  meant  trying  to  prove that  the  defendants didn’t do  what they were charged with and would involve a lengthy  explanation  of  the  history  of the  communist  movement worldwide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  some  struggle  over  these  two  lines,  but  it  was  the defensive  strategy  which  was  in  the  main  adopted.  Foster’s deposition served  as one of the  Party’s main lines of defense. In it he  outlines  a  course  of the workers’  struggle for  socialism via  a people’s front government, the perspective for achieving socialism in  the  U.S.  along constitutional  and  peaceful  channels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster  elaborated  some  on  this  point  a  year  and  a  half later: The  establishm ent  of  a  people’s  democracy  in  the  United Stales  would  signify  that  the  coalition  o f w orkers  and  their allies  had  won  a  decisive  political  victory  over  m onopoly capita)  and  that  a  government  had  come  into  power,  comm itted to the abolition o f capitalism  and the establishm ent of socialism.  Such  a  governm ent...m ight  evolve  either  from   a people’s  front  coalition  government  through  an  internal regrouping  of  forces,  or  it  might  be elected  by the  masses of the A m erican people after the people’s front governm ent had served  its...function.  In either event the working class and its allies...would  carry  through their dem ocratic program , curbing  all  violent  and  illegal  efforts  of  m onopolist  reaction  to defeat  it  and  set  up  a  fascist  state.6</p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster obviously saw the development of this theory not just as a defensive  legal  strategy,  but  as  a  political  line.  He  was later to describe  it  as,  "the  most  important  theoretical  advance  ever made  by  the  CPUSA  on  its  own  initiative.”7</p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  14,  1949,  the  eleven  were  convicted.  All  received five year sentences, except Thompson whose sentence was reduced because  of his wartime  record.  The case was appealed all the way to  the  Supreme  Court,  where  the  convictions were upheld.  They started  serving their sentences  on July 2,  1951, with the exception of  Thompson,  Hall,  Winston  and  Green,  all  of  whom  went underground.8  They  too  were  eventually  captured  or  turned themselves  in  and  served  some  time  behind  bars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Released  from  my  assignment  on  the  defense  team,  1  again</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p598"></a><img src="index-598_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">576</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">started  looking around  for a way to support myself. I would have liked to continue as a seaman, but that was impossible since it was only a matter of time before the Coast Guard would catch up with my  record.  Some  friends  suggested  that  I  write  a  sequel  to  my book,  which  had  been  translated  in  all  of the European  socialist countries with the exception  of Yugoslavia. If I got to China,I was sure  it  would  be  published  there.  Writers’  unions  in  the  various countries would undoubtedly sponsor lectures for me and ask me to  write  articles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The more I thought of the idea, the more I liked it. I discussed it with  Belle and she was enthusiastic, agreeing to come along as my secretary.  All we needed  now was an  OK  from the Party. I raised the  matter  in  the  Negro  Commission,  which  was  at  that  time headed  by  Pettis  Perry.  The  project  was approved  and  we  were given  a green  light to  raise  funds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything  went  along  fine.  A  few  fund  raising  parties  were given—one by Paul  Robeson. Some affluent individuals were also solicited.  Dashiell  Hammett  contributed  a  thousand  dollars  and said  that  he would  be satisfied  if I  wrote another book as good as the first.  In a few weeks, several thousand dollars had been raised and  Belle  and  I  booked  passage  on  the  French  liner   <i class="calibre4">DeGrasse. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A couple of days before sailing, I stopped in at the  <i class="calibre4">Daily Worker</i> office to pick up a press card. To my profound surprise, the editor, Johnny  Gates,  refused  to  give  me  one.  This  was  all  the  more astounding in  view of the fact that  Gates himself had  sent a letter accompanying my application for a passport, supporting my claim that  one of the purposes for my going abroad was to write a series of  articles  for  the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker. </i>  When  I  asked  Gates  why  he refused,  he mumbled  something about  not giving press cards out to  everybody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stunned  and  speechless,  I  went  upstairs  to  the  national  office where I saw Henry Winston, national organizational secretary. At that  time  I  thought  a  lot  of  Winston.  He  had  given  me  much needed  support  in  overcoming the  opposition  of sundry  bureaucrats  and  white  chauvinists  to  publishing my  book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  told  him  what  had  happened. “What goes on here?”  I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anybody can get a  <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> card. Why am I  refused one on the day  of my departure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p599"></a><img src="index-599_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">577</p>
<p class="calibre1">Winston  looked  perturbed.  He  went  back  into  the  office,  I presumed  either to call Gates or to consult with other members of the Secretariat.  He came back with an embarrassed expression on his face and said, “We can’t do anything about it now.” (Evidently it  was  Gates’s  decision,  and  the  Secretariat  felt  they  could  not overrule  him at the time.)  He then  said, “What’s a   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> card,  Harry,  you  really  don’t  need  one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At  least it would  be some kind of credential,” I replied. At the time  I  only  had  a  press  card  from  the   <i class="calibre4">California  Eagle</i>,  a progressive Black  newspaper in Los Angeles which was published by  Mrs. Charlotta Bass, and  a letter from the Council on African Affairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Winston  went  back  into the office again and upon returning he asked,  “Harry,  weren’t  you a friend  of Bill  Dunne?” (Dunne was among  those  who  had  been  expelled  as  a  “left  sectarian.”) I  was  astounded.  “Sure.  So  a  lot  of  people  were  friends  of Dunne.  William Foster was also a friend of his. Is that a reason for denying  me  a  press  card?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  told  me  that  I  had  been  seen  shaking  hands  with  him recently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s a lie,” I said. Then I remembered. Some members of the staff of the Jefferson  School had  given  a reception  for me on  the occasion  of the publishing of my book. While speaking, I noticed Bill Dunne in the audience.  As I stepped down from the platform, he rushed forward to shake my hand.  Knowing it would put me on the spot in front of a lot of people, I turned my back on him. Later, 1  felt  very  bad  about  it  too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I told  Winston all of this  and then asked if there were someone accusing me of a political association with  Dunne.  He evaded  all my  questions  and  said  that  the  matter could  not be settled then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go ahead,  Harry, get  on  the ship.” We shook hands and I left the  office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I called up James Ford, who, since his fall from leadership, had become much friendlier to the left. I told him what had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  said  that  “they”  were trying to  keep  me  from  going.  I  didn’t know who “they” were,  but I certainly knew that I had enemies in the  Party. </p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">PARIS</p>
<p class="calibre1">We sailed at noon the next day, and a number of friends saw us off. Someone asked,41 What are you looking so gloomy about? You should  be  happy ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am," I lied. We were leaving under a cloud and I had a gnawing premonition  that  there  were  storms  ahead.  We  were  depressed during the voyage across despite the fact that our fellow passengers included  Lena  Horne,  her  husband,  Lenny  Hayton,  Chico Hamilton  and  his  band,  and  Kenneth  Spencer,  the  well  known basso.  All were  friends  of the  left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was April  1950, and our spirits rose at the sight of Paris in the spring.  We  put  up  at  a  small  hotel  on the Rue  Montmartre  and immediately set out to contact friends and people who would be of help to us in our project. Our most important contact in Paris was an  old  friend,  Bill  Gebert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill was  Polish.  He had been secretary of the Illinois District of the Party and lived half his life in the United States, but he had not succeeded  in  getting citizenship.  He had been among the group of foreign comrades who had been rounded up and deported a couple of  years  before.  Returning  to  Poland,  he  was  assigned  to trade union  work  and  had  become  a  representative  to  the  World Federation  of  Trade  Unions  (WFTU)  and  a  member  of  its secretariat  located  in  Paris.  We were delighted  to see each other, After giving him the low down  on the situation in the U.S., I told him  about  my  project  and  asked  if he  could  be  of help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  immediately  picked  up  the  phone  and  called  the  Polish Ambassador,  who  invited  all  three  of us  to dinner at  the  Polish Emhassy  the  next  evening,  We  met  the  ambassador,  the  well-known  Polish poet, Jerzy Tutrament, who after hearing ahout my project  suggested  that  we  make  Poland  our jump-off place.  We were fortunate,  he said, for a world writers’ conference was to be held  in  Warsaw  that  summer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be easy for him to arrange for me and my wife to attend it  as  guests  of the  Polish Writers’  Union.  We  could  then  stay  in Poland  while  making  contacts  and  arrangements  for  a  visit  to other socialist countries. He said that he would take the matter up</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">579</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately  with  the  proper  authorities  and  assured  us  there would  be no difficulty,  He asked  us to come around to the Polish Consulate during the next few days and apply for visas. He would personally  see that  they  were  put  through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  a  relief?  At  last  we were  on  our  way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was at this time that we were introduced to Blackman, a West African  poet  and  then  editor of the  English edition  of the World Peace  Movement  magazine,  which  was  published  in  Paris.  He knew William Patterson and Paul Robeson, and later proved to be one  of the  best  friends  we  had  in  Paris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We met  Gabriel  Marie D’Arboussier, a representative from the Ivory Coast, who was then vice-president  of the  French Union, a member of the Chamber of Deputies and  general secretary of the African  Democratic  Rally, a liberation movement embracing the former French colonics of West  Africa.  It was through him that I met  a  number  of  black  deputies  and  senators,  including  Felix Houphouet-Boigny, president of the rally. Although a millionaire and  owner  of  a  large  plantation,  he  was  then  considered  a progressive.  (Today  he  is  president  of the  Ivory  Coast  Republic and  quite conservative.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then there was a young Frenchman named  Herv6, who was the editor  of   <i class="calibre4">Action</i>  magazine,  a  progressive  Parisian  journal.  He interviewed  D’Arboussier,  Belle and myself for his paper. We had a very cordial discussion of the similarities and differences between the  struggles  of  the  colonially  oppressed  people  in  Africa  and Black people in the U.S. Stimulated by this discussion, I wrote an article on the condition  of Blacks in  the  U.S, for the paper of the anti-colonialist  youth  movement  at  the  Sorbonne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of my most memorable experiences in Paris was the Bastille Day Parade of July.14,1950. Tens of thousands of people gathered to  march through the working class districts of Paris. Communist Party leaders like Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos shared the speakers*  platform  with  Black  deputies,  senators  and  other dignitaries  from  the  former  French  colonies  with  whom  they  had, through the  post-war  years,  developed  a  close  relationship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belle  and  I  were  in  the  parade  and  it  was  a  very  exciting and invigorating experience for us both. The Korean War had just</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken  out and  1  remember the  militant  chants of MLa Cordeaux Cordens (Korea for the Koreans).” We saw thousands of Algerians lining up  in  the  side  streets  and  preparing to join  the  march. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Paris  we  were  never  bored.  Our  new  friends  took  us everywhere.  D’Arboussier took us to his home in the country. We also  visited  Houphouet-Boigny  at  his  chateau  about  thirty  kilometers  from  Paris.  Wc  met  a  number of African  senators  and deputies,  and  D’Arboussier  was  organizing  a  banquet  in  my honor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By this time,  however, we  began to  worry about our project.  It was drawing near the date  of the Writers' Conference in  Warsaw, and  even  some  American  delegates  began  passing through Paris on  their way  to  the  conference.  For  instance,  we  heard  that  Joe North, a well-known communist writer, was in town  on his way to Warsaw.  Others,  like  Mrs.  Bass,  were going to  the World  Peace Conference  in  Prague.  Still  we  had  received  no  word  from  the Polish  Embassy.  We  had  called there several times,  and we were told  that  the  visas  had  not  come  through  yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill  Gebert  was  out  of town  on  a long tour of Asia and  North Africa for the  WFTU,  so  we had  no way of finding out what was behind  all  the  delay.  We  had  been  in  Paris  almost  three  months now  and  to add  to our anxiety, we were pretty sure that we were being  followed.  When  the  conference  convened  in  Warsaw,  we knew very definitely that something was wrong.  Then we realized that  we  hadn’t  seen  D’Arboussier  or  Blackman  in  days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While sitting  in  our  hotel  room  one  night  in  deep depression, there was a knock at the door and a good friend of ours, an African (whose  name  I  won’t  mention  in  this  context),  entered.  He  was frowning  and  we  knew  it  was  bad  news.  “What’s  up?”  I  asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got some bad news for you,” he said. He then proceeded to tell  us  that  a  few  days  earlier  he  had  been  called  in  to  see  a representative  of the Central Committee of the French Party and had  been  told  that  they  had  it  from  reliable  sources  that  Harry Haywood  was  a  spy  of the  U.S.  State  Department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  friend  said  that  he  had  been  horrified  by  the  news  and insisted  that  it  could  not  possibly  be true.  “I told  him that I  had known  you  only  in  Paris,  but  that  you  had  come  with  letters  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">581</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduction  from  Paul  Robeson, William  Patterson  and  others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since then I had received letters from other friends, verifyingyour credentials  and  asking  me  to  do  everything  to  expedite  your project.  So  I  told  him,”  he  continued,  “that  they  were  making a horrible mistake.  But the representative of the Central Committee insisted  that  their  sources  were  reliable,  that  they  had  the information  from  their  security  people.  Furthermore,  it did  not originate  from  here,  but  from  over  there (in  the  U.S.).” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He told  me further that the French Central Committee had sent word  out to  all progressive organizations in  Paris, warning them about me and requesting that I be barred from all of their offices as an  enemy agent.  “He then  warned  me, under pain  of disciplinary action,  to  sever  my  relationship  with  you  and  under  no  circumstances  was  I to inform you of these charges.  I thought about this  a  few  days  and  finally  decided  to  violate  their  discipline because 1  was sure that they were  wrong.  It  was terribly unfair to you  and  your  wife  not  to have  told  you  about  it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We sat there stunned.  Finally our friend asked, “Harry, do you have any bonafides besides the letters from the Council on African Affairs?  Haven’t  you  got  anything from  the  Party  itself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  admitted  I  had  nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he said, HYou had better get in touch with them as quick as possible.”  He  rose and  said, “I  wish  you good people the  best  of luck.  I’m sure that  things will turn  out all right.  And that  we  will meet  under  more  pleasant  circumstances.”  He  embraced  us  and left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,  it  had  become clear why we  had  not received  our Polish visa;  why  D’Arboussier  and  other  friends  had  stopped  coming around;  why  we  were  being  tailed,  probably  both  by  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Embassy and the  French  Communist  Party; and why I had heard no  more  about  the  affair  being  planned  for  me  by  the  African Democratic  Rally.  We  were  now  completely  isolated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We went immediately to the Grand Hotel on the Boulevard des Cupucines,  across  from  the  Opera  House,  where  I  telephoned Patterson in  New York.  I  told  him  of our predicament and asked him to relay the message immediately to the Secretariat.  He was of course astounded  and  promised he would  do so  first thing in the</p>

<p class="calibre1">morning.  He told  us  to  keep our spirits up and that I would hear from  someone  in a  few  days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That night I had my first ulcer attack. The next morning, I called the WFTU to see if Gebert had returned. Fortunately, he had and we took a cab to his office. As I told him the story, he kept shaking his  head  and  muttering,  “Unbelievable.”  Finally,  after  I  had finished, be said, "I  had heard things were not so good back there, but  I  didn't  think  they  were  that  bad.”  He  then  told  us  that Tutrament had  been assigned a new job as president of the Polish Writers'  Union  and  that  there was  now  a  new  ambassador. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then  picked  up the phone and called the Polish Embassy to find  out  what  had  happened  to  our  applications  for  visas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Listening intently for a moment or two, he put down the receiver, then shook  his head and said, “They say, Harry, that they did not find it possible to give you a visa at this time. That’s all they would say.”  It  was  now  apparent  to  me  that  the word  had  been spread throughout the international communist community that  I  was a spy.  But  by  that  time  I  had  become  quite  immune  to  shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several days later, I received a letter from Patterson in which he stated that he had brought the matter before the Secretariat. They were all profoundly shocked and all disclaimed any knowledge of the  source of the spy charge, denying that  it  came from there.  He said that they were taking the matter up and that I should stand by to  hear  from  Winston  in  a  couple  of days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The letter from Winston arrived, expressing his regrets and those of the other leading comrades over the unfortunate turn of events which  had  prevented  me  from  proceeding  with  my  project.  He assured  me that they all  had the fullest confidence in my integrity and  were profoundly shocked  by the charges.  He went on further to  explain  that  during  the  war,  communication  lines with  other parties  had  been broken. They had not yet been fully restored and perhaps that was the source of all this confusion.  He suggested that we return to tbe States while they straightened the matter out and then  start  over again,  this  time  under  the  auspices  of the  Party, with  the  proper credentials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was August  and  we ran into the rush of Americans returning home when we tried to book passage. The only thing available was</p>

<p class="calibre1">lirst  class  passage  on  a  ship,  sailing  from  Antwerp,  Belgium,  in about  two  weeks.  Winston  wired  me $600 for fare and expenses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With time on our bands and anxious to get out of Paris, we went to Amsterdam to  visit Otto and Hermie Huiswood.  After serving as  head  of the  International  Negro  Trade  Union  Committee  in Hamburg,  Germany,  and  being  forced  to  flee  from  one  country lifter  another  in  the  face  of  the  fascist  advance  of  the  thirties, Huiswood returned to the U.S.just before the fall of France. With IJ.S,  entry into the war, however, he returned to his native Dutch (iuyana where he was soon thrown into a concentration camp by the  Dutch.  When  he  was  released  after  the  war,  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">government  refused  to  let  him  back  into  the country.  Huiswood and  his  wife  then  decided  to  settle  in  Holland  where  he  was recognized  as  a  citizen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">COLD  WAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">Einally  we  boarded  the  ship  at  Antwerp  for  an  uneventful passage  home.  We  were met  at the dock in New York  by Maude White and her hushand,  Arthur Katz.  Immediately upon landing, I  got in touch with the national office.  I was told that a meeting of the  Secretariat  had  been  arranged  for  the  next  morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving  at  the  national  office,  I  was  met  by  my  old  friend, Claude  Lightfoot,  whom  the  leadership  had  brought  in  from Chicago  especially  for  the  occasion.  “Now  Harry,  hold  your temper,  keep cool,” he pleaded with me. “Just keep cool and well work  things  out.”  Nearly the whole  of the Politburo was present for  the  meeting,  including  Hall,  Stachel,  Winston,  Perry  and Davis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was very angry and demanded that something be done. “After all,”  I  said,  “the  French  said  it  came from  here.”  No  one in  the leadership  appeared  to  have any  knowledge of where the  rumors had originated. After considerable discussion, the meeting came to a  very  unsatisfactory  conclusion.  While  it  was  generally  agreed that I should return to Paris with proper Party credentials, nothing to my knowledge was ever done to get at the source of the security</p>

<p class="calibre1">breach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  days  later 1  went  to see  Louis Burnham,  a young Black friend  of mine  who  had  been  enthusiastic  about  my project  and had  helped  to  sponsor  and  promote  it.  Lou  was  then  editor  of <i class="calibre4">Freedom</i>,  Paul  Robeson’s  paper,  and  he  greeted  me  warmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What the hell happened over there?” he asked, and I ran down the whole  story  for  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said he had heard about the charges against me at a meeting of  the  staff.  “We  were  dumbfounded.”  He  named  the  staff members, all of whom I knew. Then with a thoughtful look he said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One  guy  said,  *1  am  not  surprised  to  hear  that  about  Harry.’  ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who  was  that  guy?”  I  interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lou  suddenly  clammed  up  and  refused  to  tell  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  pleaded  with  bim,  but  he  only  said,  “Ah,  it  doesn’t  matter, Harry.  It  occurred  in  a  staff  meeting,  and  I  can’t  go  around circulating  stories  ahout what  happened  in  staff meetings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  left  Lou  and  walked  down  125th  Street,  wondering who  my accuser was.  I  never found out  and  never went  back  to  Paris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  returning from Paris in the fall  of 1950,1 could see that the Party was  in a state of panic and hysteria, retreating in the face of the government’s attack on the Party and the left. The McCarran Act  had  just  been  passed,  making  communism  a  foreign  conspiracy  and  communists  foreign  agents.  Described  by  many  as a blueprint  for  fascism,  the  act  called  for  the  registration  of communists  and  laid  the  basis  for  deportation  and  prosecution under the  Smith  Act  of thousands  of Party  members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  September  1949,  I  had  been  among  a crowd of 15,000 at a peace  rally  in  Peekskill,  New  York,  when a gang of fascist thugs attacked the crowd just as Paul Robeson was on stage singing. In late  1951,  eighty-three  year  old  W.E.B.  DuBois  was  tried  on  a charge  of  espionage  for  his  sponsorship  of  the  World  Peace Appeal,  a  petition  against  the  war  in  Korea.  The  government accused a  quiet  young Jewish  couple  from  the Lower East Side, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, of being master atom spies. They were arrested  in  July  1950  and  executed  three  years  later,  despite  a massive international defense campaign on their behalf. Following the jailing  of the  Party  leaders  in  1951,  secondary  Party  leaders</p>

<p class="calibre1">585</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  indicted  in  a  number  of  states.  These  included  Elizabeth Gurley  Flynn,  Claudia  Jones,  Pettis  Perry,  Betty  Gannett,  A1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lannon,  Olcta  O’Connor Yates  and  Steve Nelson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Years of illusions about bourgeois democracy had left the Party virtually unprepared for this governmental assault. Our Party had clearly  never  expected  such  a  development  and  had  not  built an effective  secret  apparatus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  we  did  make  a  feeble  attempt  to  set  up  some  sort  of underground  in  the  early  fifties,  its  main  purpose  was  not  to continue  the  work  under  changed  conditions,  but  to  hide  the Party, to weather the storm, so to speak. This period of repression, which  would  normally have  been  anticipated and planned for by communists,  came  as  a  surprise to  our  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  immediate  response  was  to  greatly  overestimate  the attack.  Party offices and sections were closed down, mass work cut back  and  membership  consciously  allowed  to  drop  off.  The Politburo  dissolved  the  Southern  region  of the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This approach only served to increase the hysterical atmosphere in  the  Party,  as  well  as  taking  a  concrete  step  toward  its organizational  liquidation.  I  went  to  see  Henry  Winston  at  the national office the day before he was scheduled to begin serving his sentence,  but  no  one  was  there  except  Ben  Davis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  asked  him  what  he thought I could do  to  help the  Party, but decided  not  to take his advice when  he said, “Aw, just go out and lose yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thousands  of  other  Party  members,  however,  were  actually directed  to  go  out  and start  new  lives for themselves, to  have  no contact with the Party, to  do no political work.  Many were never heard  from  again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  top  leadership  was  in  jail,  Pettis  Perry  and  Betty Gannett  became the administrative committee of the Party, a sort of caretaker  leadership.  They  made  day-to-day  policy decisions and  provided  the  main  link  with  the  underground section of the leadership, Foster remained as Party chairman, but his health kept him  mostly confined  to  his  apartment  in the  Bronx. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gannett  and Perry actively fostered such  liquidationist moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  many  comrades  feared  to  re-register,  the  Party  also</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p608"></a><img src="index-608_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">586</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberately lost contact with hundreds of its memhers. There are some  high  level  Party  functionaries  who  believe  that  a  secret decision was made by the National  Board at this time to drop one-third of the membership in order to make the Party a smaller, more manageable  cadre  organization.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether  or  not  this  actually  took  place,  it  is  in  effect  what happened. In 1956, Foster evaluated the period of the cold war and characterized  the  “approach  taken  to  security”  as  “the  worst error of the whole Cold War period. It did our Party great injury in losses  of members  and  mass  contacts,”  he  wrote.10  Foster  incorrectly  characterized  this  error as  “leftism,”  instead  of seeing it as part  of the  whole  rightward  retreat  of the  Party.  Police and FBI infiltration  reached  new  heights  in  this  period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  PARTY'S  PHONY  WAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">Things weren't easy for  Belle and myself at this time either. We were  still  broke,  unemployed  and  unemployable.  I  was  working with the Party's Education Department and teaching some classes, as  well  as  working  with  William  Patterson  on   <i class="calibre4">We  Charge</i> <i class="calibre4">Genocide. </i>  But  none  of this  paid  any  money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  that  the  FBI  was  always  about  one step behind me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When 1 did get a job, usually as a waiter, I would be fired a few days later for some inexplicable reason.  Eventually a friend  helped me get  into  Local  Six  of the  Hotel  and  Restaurant Workers  Union, and  I  was  then  able  to  hold  down some jobs  with  a  measure  of security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against  this  background  of  panic,  hard  times  and  police infiltration and harassment, the Party continued its  march to the right.  Inevitably our revolutionary line and  program on the Afro-American  question  was  left  to  fall  by  the  way.  Concomitantly, white  chauvinist  attitudes  and  practices  were  once  more  on the rise.  What  was  needed  was  a  reaffirmation  of our  revolutionary line and an intensive campaign of education, in combination with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p609"></a><img src="index-609_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">587</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass  work.  The  leadership responded instead with what  1  would characterize  as the “phony  war against  white  chauvinism.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather  than  coming  out  wholeheartedly  in  support  of  our revolutionary  position,  a  kind  of  moral  crusade  was  launched which was completely divorced from  any mass work.  Refusing to examine  the  full  implications  of  Black  oppression  as  national oppression,  it  was  assumed  that  chauvinist  practices  could  be eliminated  by wiping  out  wrong  ideas  and  attitudes  of the Party rank and file.  White chauvinism came to be considered as a sort of phenomenon;  a  thing  in  itself,  separate  from  the  fight  for  Black rights and  proletarian  revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, white chauvinism was strengthened as a result of this </p>
<p class="calibre1">“phony war.” In discussing the period, I cannot overemphasize the effects of FBI  and  police infiltration, provocation and incitement and  their consistently and  consciously  disruptive  activities.  I  am sure that agents were involved from start to finish on both sides of the  fence,  although  none  were  actually  exposed  through  the campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  struggle  began  with  an article  in  the  June  1949   <i class="calibre4">Political</i> <i class="calibre4">Affairs</i> which was written hy Pettis  Perry,  newly  appointed  head of the National  Negro Commission.11  Perry pointed to numerous manifestations of white chauvinism which undoubtedly the Party had  to  overcome in order to play a leading role in the rising civil rights  struggles  of the  time.  But  Perry  was  not capable of giving correct  leadership  to  this  struggle  since  he  shared  the  general rightist  orientation  of the  National  Committee.  In  fact,  all  this activity on his  part it seemed to me was a cover for our failure to boldly  take  up  or  initiate  mass  struggle  in the  Black  movement, leaving  us  to tail  the  NAACP. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  start,  the  struggle  emphasized  administrative  solutions (expulsions, penalties and removing people from leadership) in a complete distortion of proper communist methods of criticism and  self-criticism.  The  purpose  of  criticism  is  to  strengthen  the Party,  to  consolidate  the  cadres  behind  the  correct  line  and practice  through  exposing errors and rectifying them in practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Yokinen, the  Finnish communist from  Harlem, was found guilty  of white chauvinism  in  1931,  his program for  rectification</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p610"></a><img src="index-610_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">$ 8 8</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">involved playing a leading role in the movement for Black rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yokinen did this, fully vindicating himself in the eyes of the Party and  the  Black  masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  such  actions  were  taken  in  the  “phony  war.”  Instead, inquisitorial  type  hearings  and  committees  were  set  up—veteran cadres raked over the coals (often with little or no cause), censured, and  many  expelled.  A  view  developed  which  contended  that the Party could  not  move  forward,  that  mass work  had to wait, until all  vestiges of white chauvinism were driven  from the ranks. This view  was  thoroughly idealist and  contradicted the experiences  of the  socialist  countries,  where  the  struggle  against  great  nation chauvinism  goes  on  even  in  the period  of socialist development. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This purist approach led the fight to take on a sort of intramural character in  which success was measured  not  by the organization of mass struggles in defense of Black rights, but  in the number of comrades against whom disciplinary action was taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an atmosphere which was conducive to the development of  a  particularly  paternalistic  and  patronizing  form  of  white chauvinism,  as  well  as  to  a  rise  in  petty  bourgeois  narrow nationalism among  Blacks,  The  growth  of the nationalist side of this  distortion  was  directly linked  to the  breakdown  of the  basic division  of  labor among  communists  in  relation  to  the  national question. This division of labor, long ago established in  our Party and  the international  communist  movement, places main  responsibility  for  combating  white  chauvinism  on  the  white  comrades, with  Blacks  having  main  responsibility  for  combating  narrow nationalist  deviations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Pettis  Perry  came forward  as  the “chief prosecutor”  of white  chauvinists,  this  division  of tasks,  so essential  to  building firm  unity  of the  races,  was  clearly  violated.  On  the  one  hand  it allowed  the  leading  white  comrades  to  abdicate  their  responsibilities  in  fighting  chauvinism  and  rallying  white  workers  in defense  of Black rights;  while on  the other, it left Perry and other leading Blacks as the “defenders” of Blacks against white chauvinists.  The dangers  of narrow  nationalism  were  ignored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  view developed  that  any  act  by  a white person which any Black resented  was, ipso facto, white chauvinism. Such an analysis</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p611"></a><img src="index-611_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">589</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  of  course  completely  devoid  of  class  content.  In  the  final analysis,  it was used  to attack our revolutionary line on the Black national  question  which  was  always  based  on  the  fight  for international  solidarity  of the  working  class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  tendencies,  racist  paternalism  and  narrow  nationalism, merged in a line of capitulation to the imperialist ruling class. The common denominator of both, their theoretical foundation, rested in  the treatment  of peoples  comprising  an  oppressed  nation  as a socially undifferentiated mass. All Blacks, regardless of their class, were considered  revolutionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time,  I wrote about the character white supremacy took on,  saying,  uln  this  case,  the  capitulation  of white  comrades  to Negro  nationalism  is in  itself an expression of white chauvinism, reflecting a hangover of bourgeois  liberal, paternalistic attitudes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of all  forms  of white chauvinism,”  I  wrote, “patronization  is the most subtle, insidious, and perhaps most pernicious type, because it parades under the banner o f‘concern’for the Negro (sometimes hiding a real desertion of the struggle for Negro rights).  <i class="calibre4">It is a form</i> <i class="calibre4">which  tolerates,  coddles</i>,  <i class="calibre4">encourages</i>,  <i class="calibre4">and  panders  to  Negro</i> <i class="calibre4">bourgeois  nationalism  as  it  retreats  before  it.9*12</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  double  standard  existed  whereby  white  comrades  might criticize other whites,  but not Black comrades. A white making a criticism  of a  Black comrade for narrow  nationalism was  usually branded  a  chauvinist.  This  denied  Blacks the benefit  of criticism and self-criticism.  I  remember how such patronization thoroughly angered  many  of our  working  class  Black  cadres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  struggle  wore  on,  and  it  lasted  a  good  four  years,  it assumed a more and more vicious character. I have no doubt that the  FBI  considered  it  a job  well  done.  White comrades  began to fear  visiting  Black  comrades,  afraid  they  might  do  or  say something that could be considered  white chauvinist. The war was even  carried  into  the  realm  of  semantics.  Comrades  who  used expressions  like “black coffee”  or “black sheep” were liable to  be charged  with  chauvinism.13</p>

<p class="calibre1">both  white.  Earl Conrad was a very close friend of the Party.14 In 1950,  he  wrote   <i class="calibre4">Rock  Bottom</i> f  the story of a Black woman in the Florida  Everglades,  where  Blacks lived  under very primitive and slave-likc  conditions.15  Somehow this book,  which  was  based on actual interviews, was construed to be degrading to Black people, and  Conrad  was  heavily  censured  by  the  Party  for  white chauvinism.  There  were countless  other incidents  like these. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tbe whole thing really struck home when  Belle was accused of white  chauvinism  in  early  1953.  She  had  been  working  as  a manager  at  the  Jefferson  School  lunchroom.  One  day  a  young Black  man  returned  to  the  counter  where  she  was  serving  and stated that she bad given him twenty-five cents too much change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belle thanked him and asked how she had made the error since she didn’t  want  to  repeat  it.  The  young  man  opened  his  hand  with change  still  in  it  and  Belle  pointed  with  her  index  finger,  noting that  she  had  given  him too many quarters.  Later that afternoon, the young  man  came  back  and  told  her  he  resented  her  act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  act?”  she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  act  of white  chauvinism  when  you  went  into  my  hand,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belle  explained  that  she  had  only  meant to  check  herself and certainly intended no insult. The student refused to be mollified by this  and  insisted  that  it  was white  chauvinism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belle refused to accept this view and they debated a few minutes, when  suddenly  he asked, “Who  is your  husband?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  does  my  hushand  have  to  do  with  this?”  she  asked, refusing to  answer  his  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re a white chauvinist, like all the rest of white Americans,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  shouted  and  left  the  cafeteria. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belle reported the incident to Doxey Wilkerson who was on the staff of the school.  At the time,  he agreed with  her that  no act of white  chauvinism  was  involved.  He explained to  Belle that  there was  a  tendency  to  distort  the struggle  against  white  chauvinism among  some  of  the  younger  students.  Ahout  a  month  later, however,  a  committee  was  set  up  to  investigate  the  matter  and found Belle guilty of seventeen separate acts of white chauvinism stemming  from  the  incident,  and  of developing  an  entire  white chauvinist  line. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  was  to  be  eight  months  hefore  she  was  cleared  of  these charges and even then  the leadership tried to cover up the political questions in order to “establish peace.” Involved in the accusations that were brought against Belle were not only the school staff, but representatives of the state leadership as well. All exhorted her to accept  the  view  of  the  student,  since  her  refusal  only  “compounded"  the  errors  of white  chauvinism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  student  later  admitted  that  he  had  asked  about  her husband  because  he  believed  that  “most  women  who  marry Negro  men  are  more  chauvinistic  than  others.”  Not  a  word  of criticism  of the student  was  raised with regards to this slander. In fact,  his position was  openly supported by a Black woman on the school  staff and  by the  state  representative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attack on my wife was unmistakably directed at me as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Belle were a white chauvinist, then what must her Black husband be?  Surely  the  most  base,  groveling  conciliator  of white  chauvinism.  The  incident  clearly  served  the  interest  of  the  rising reformist  trend  in the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  situations  were  fertile  ground  for  the  enemy,  whose infiltrations  were  stepped  up  both  within and  without the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d  often  find two  characters  from  the  FBI waiting for me at  my doorstep, and they would follow me down to the subway station a few  blocks  away  at  103rd  Street  and  Central  Park West, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey  Harry,  how long are you going to stand for what they’re doing to  you  and  your  wife?” they  would  ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look what  they  did  to you in California,  and in Spain!  Why don’t  you  get  next  to  yourself,  man,  and  cooperate  with  us? We don’t  want  you  to take the  stand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I would walk along,  paying them no mind, until wc reached the station entrance.  It was early morning rush hour and hundreds of people,  including many progressives and CP members who knew me,  were  entering the station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The agents would follow me right up to the rail and then holler, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for your cooperation,  Mr. Haywood. Thank you very much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  idea  of  this  kind  of  harassment  was  obviously  to  break down  my  defenses  and  add  yet  another  recruit  to  their roster of</p>

<p class="calibre1">informants and stool pigeons.  I got to know this pair quite well, as they  were  my  regular tails  for  several  months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the meantime,  I  became more and more concerned  with the Party’s so-called war on white chauvinism. The whole method and atmosphere surrounding Belle’s case, the persecution of a devoted working  class  cadre,  smacked  to  me  of the  most  crass  form  of opportunism  and  stool  pigeonry.  During  all  the  meetings  concerning the matter, there was no.attempt to get at the substance of the charges, only to convince Belle that she was guilty. It amounted to no more than political bullying and a bureaucratic stifling of all criticism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  prepared a document in protest of the frame-up and presented it  at  a  meeting  where  the  charges  were  finally  dropped.  In  the paper,  1  discussed  not  only  Belle’s case,  but the broader implications such distortions had for the unity of Black and white students at  the  school  and  in  the  Party  as  a  whole.  I  was  convinced  that something  more  had  to  be done  about the situation  and  went to talk  about  it  with  Foster  at  his  apartment  in  the  Bronx.  He and Belle were old friends from the miners’ struggles in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.  He  was  concerned  about  her  case,  as  well  as  the general situation in the Party.  He told me that the Party in Denver had  been  virtually  liquidated  through  just  such  distortions.  I showed  him  the  document  1  had  prepared  and  he  invited  me to attend  a  meeting  of the  National  Board  to  discuss  the  matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the topic came up on the agenda, Pettis  Perry began his usual  ritual  recounting  of  yet  another  incident  of  white  chauvinism.  But  I  took the wind out of his sails  when I  pointed to the many  distortions  in  this  struggle,  “Yes,”  I  said,  “there  is  white chauvinism in the Party, but it has combined with petty bourgeois nationalism  and  we  must  wage  a fight  on  both  fronts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was very angry when Foster cut me off, True, the Party had to stop  this  campaign,  it  had  gone too  far,  he said.  There were too many  excesses.  But  there  was  no  danger  of  petty  bourgeois nationalism.  What  was  involved  here,  according  to  Foster,  was that  old  perennial  Party  menace,  “left  sectarianism.”  This  line seemed absurd to me, but  Foster was able to win over the National Board  with  it.  Following  the  meeting,  Foster  wrote  an  article, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p615"></a><img src="index-615_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">593</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Left  Sectarianism  in  the  Fight  for  Negro  Rights  and  Against White Chauvinism,” which was successful in putting an end to this most  vicious and  destructive  campaign.16</p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster’s line of attack, however, effectively took the heat off the right and capitulated fully to the bourgeois reformists in the Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster  failed  miserably  to  understand  how  the  whole  campaign served  the  right  all  along  the  way,  from  the  further  physical liquidation of the Party to pulling back from a leading role (or any role)  in  the  mass  movement,  to  substituting  petty  bourgeois nationalism  and  demagogy  for  our  revolutionary  line.  White chauvinism  was  actually  strengthened,  becoming  increasingly entrenched  in  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I tend to think that a number of honest comrades were not able to  take  a  correct  stand  in  this  struggle  because  of  a  failure  to understand the class  basis of petty  bourgeois nationalism and the potential threat it posed to the Party. The view was then prevalent that narrow nationalism was only a “reflex,” a subjective reaction to white chauvinism. To combat it, one need only take up the fight against  white  chauvinism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  view  is  fundamentally  incorrect,  although  chauvinism certainly docs  stimulate such tendencies. Narrow nationalism has its own social and economic base among the ghetto nationalists of the Black petty bourgeois and bourgeois strata. The nationalism of these sections  reflects,  in  the main, the struggle of the small Black entrepreneur  or the  middle  class  professional  whose market and sphere of activity is confined almost exclusively to the ghetto. Such strata  find  themselves  in  competition  both  with  small  and medium-sized  white business  in the  Black community, as well as with  the  monopolists.  The  nationalism  of  these  strata  has  two aspects,  one  expressing  their  aspirations  for  social  equality  and against Jim  Crow,  the other expressing the tendency to retain the segregated  market.  Thus  their  stand  toward  imperialism  is  continually vacillating.  I  think too many comrades tended to confuse the progressive national aspirations of Black people for liberation, with  narrow  nationalism  as  an  ideology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  can  now  see  in  retrospect  how  well  all  this  fit  in  with  the growing attack on the Party’s revolutionary line, which based itself</p>

<p class="calibre1">on  the  fighting,  principled  unity  of  Black  and  white,  and  the leading  role  of the  working class  in  the  struggle  for equality,  As manifested  within  the  Party,  the  petty  bourgeois  nationalist deviation  reflected  a  lack  of  faith  in  the  working  class  and  its communist  vanguard.  How,  the  pessimists  wondered,  could  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“inherently”  racist  white  working class ever be rallied  to support the fight for  Black liberation? This pessimism was extended even to  Black  comrades  who  seriously fought  for  the  internationalist position  in  the  Party,  as  was  evident  in  the attack  on  Belle and myself.  This position is actually one of retreat before the ideology of  white  chauvinism,  equivalent  to  giving  up  to  the  white supremacist  enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  “phony  war”  created  hostility,  bitterness  and  distrust among formerly close comrades. This was reflected in the break up of the Party organization  and individuals into hostile camps. The constant  pressures  of  outlandish  charges,  unprincipled  accusations, police harassment and seemingly unresolvablc antagonisms, had a telling effect on many individual relationships, including my relationship  with  Belle,  Such circumstances eventually  led  to the breakup  of our  marriage in  1955. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A prime example of the ideological confusion and lack of clarity which  accompanied  the  distorted  struggle  against  white  chauvinism  was  the Jefferson  School  Memorandum,  whose principal author was Doxey Wilkerson. This document originated as papers prepared for an educational conference on “race theories” held by the  school  in  the  fall  of  1951.  The  purported  reason  for  the conference was to develop further  “the Marxist conception of the Negro  question  as  a  national  question.” 17  But  in  the  guise of polemics against “bourgeois racist ideology,” it turned out to be another  attack  on  our  revolutionary  position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  authors’  position was cloaked  in a lot  of pseudo-scientific verbiage,  but  boiled  down  to  the  outlandish  argument  that  race and  racial  characteristics  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  special oppression  of Afro-Americans.  The  position  was  hased  on  two fallacious  ideas.  The  first  was  that  “there  are  no  races  of mankind and the term ‘Negro race’ has no meaning and should be abandoned.”  The  second  was  that  the  definition  of  “Negro” </p>

<p class="calibre1">595</p>
<p class="calibre1">referred to a person who “shares the common psychological makeup  of the  Negro  people of the  United  States.”18</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  quite  alarmed  when  I  first  read  this  memorandum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coming as it did  in the midst of the destructive campaign against white  chauvinism,  I  felt  it  would  further distort the struggle and introduce new confusion into an already poorly understood area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  how would the Party explain to the  masses of Blacks that race was  not a factor in their subjugation?  How  would  the Party develop  struggle  against  white  chauvinism  among  the  white workers  if the “Negro race”  did  not  exist? How would  the Party uphold the special internationalist responsibilities of Afro-Americans  to  support  the  struggles  of  blacks  in  Africa  and  Latin America?  Obviously,  adopting Doxey’s line would lead  to isolating the Party from the masses of Blacks, abandoning the struggle to build a mass movement in support of Black rights among white workers, and  undermining the militant solidarity  of Afro-Americans  with  blacks  in  the  third  world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  immediately  wrote a  rebuttal  which  I  planned  to  give to the editorial board of  <i class="calibre4">Political Affairs</i>. I argued that racial persecution of the  Negro  people  is  a  particular  form  and  device  of national oppression, and that it was wrong to counterpose the two.19 It was clearly  idealism  and  not  Marxism  to  try  to  overcome  the phenomena of racial differences and white chauvinism by discarding  the  term  “race.”  This  denial  of reality  was  one  of the  more bizarre forms  taken  by  assimilationism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The publication and circulation of the Wilkerson memorandum touched off considerable debate and discussion, which would last for almost a year. When 1 submitted my article to  <i class="calibre4">Political Affairs,</i> I  felt  it  would  add  to this  discussion  and  help clarify the issues.  I found,  however,  that  Doxey  and  the  co-authors  of  the  memorandum had a protector in  Betty Gannett.  She was very reluctant to  publish  my  article  for  its  sharpness  might  discredit  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">“important leaders,”  members of the Party’s Educational Department  After  all, she said, the  matter was still  being discussed and meetings  were  scheduled  to  clarify  the  matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite its timeliness and my insistence, the publication of my article was postponed.  I attended several of the meetings to discuss</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p618"></a><img src="index-618_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">596</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  position  put  forward  by  the  memorandum.  Even  with  the sharp discussion  and  the  difficulty  the  authors  had  in defending their  position,  many  comrades  were reluctant  to characterize the position for what  it was—a  harmful deviation which undermined the struggle against while chauvinism.  In fact, the position struck at the roots of our revolutionary line by denying the concrete facts and  particular forms  of  national  oppression of Afro-Americans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  realized that if Betty Gannett  had her way, publication of my article  would  continue  to  be  postponed.  In  early spring,  several months after 1 submitted the draft to  <i class="calibre4">Political Affairs, </i> I sent a copy to Foster and asked his opinion. I received a reply on April 21,1952, in  which  he  agreed  with  the  main  line  of the  article.  He  offered several  criticisms  which  helped  strengthen  the  document,  and  I incorporated them into a new draft.  Evidently, he also sent copies of these letters to   <i class="calibre4">Political Affairs</i> and  to the Jefferson School It wasn’t  long after I received his reply that I was called into another meeting  with  Lil  Gates,  Theodore  Bassett  and  Alberto  Moreau, the  education director of the  New  York district.  Doxey,  Howard Selsam and  David  Goldway  from  the Jefferson School staff were also  present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  made a  rather lengthy presentation at this meeting, reading my document.  Doxey  attempted  to  defend  his  position,  but  quickly found that  those present  no longer agreed with him, At one point Selsam  exclaimed,  “Doxey,  you’re  talking  like  a  bourgeois professor!”  Doxey’s  position  was thoroughly rejected  and it  was agreed  that  my  article  would  be  printed  in the   <i class="calibre4">PA. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was somewhat surprised, therefore, to see it wasn’t in the next issue of the journal.  1 couldn’t understand what had postponed its publication, My answer came in the August  1952   <i class="calibre4">PA</i>  in an article titled  uRace,  Nation,  and  the  Concept  ’Negro’  ”  by  Doxey  Wilkerson. The article was a lengthy self-criticism, rejecting his earlier formulations and characterizing it as a “theoretically unsound and politically  harmful..deviation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 found t hat he had adopted most of the criticisms 1 had made of his  position.  This  recantation  had  been  long  in  coming  and  its timing took much of the sting out of my polemic, rendering it as a rather anti-climactic part  of the struggle.  Finally, in October 1952, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p619"></a><img src="index-619_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">597</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  was  published,  changed  somewhat  in  light  of  Doxey*s  self-criticism.  The long delay  showed  clearly  that  the  leadership was not willing to give credit  or prominence to any spokesman for the revolutionary  tendency  in  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilkerson’s theory was in itself of little significance,  it was too preposterous to have any lasting impact.  Its real significance was in  the  manner in which  the Party Leadership was able to use it to obscure  the  real  issues  and  suppress  the  ideological  struggle necessary  to  reassert  a  Marxist-Leninist  position on the national question.  By  protecting  and  promoting  Wilkerson’s  theory,  the leadership  forcibly  shifted  the focus  of the debate away from  the key questions; self-determination and the Party’s leadership role in the  Black  liberation  and  working class  struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  no  accident  that  Wilkerson’s  assimilationist  approach developed to muddy the waters  in  this period of the march to the right.  It left the field open for all sorts of liberal bourgeois theories, and was an expression of the rising trend in the Party to tail after the  bourgeois  assimilationist  leadership  of  the  NAACP.  Reformism  in  the  field  of  work  among  Blacks  would  politically express  itself  much  more  clearly  in  the  coming  years  with  the complete  acceptance  of the  NAACP  as  the vanguard,  “the vital center of the  Negro  people’s  movement.”20</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resurgence  of this  right  wing trend  in the Party was given added encouragement by the prosperity of the war and immediate post-war  period.  Figures  from  the  Department  of  Labor  reveal that during these years, for the first time in history, there appeared a  trend  toward  closing  the  gap  between  Black  and  white  living standards.  From  1939 to  1947,  earnings of Blacks increased from 41.4% to  54.3%  of white  wages.21</p>
<p class="calibre1">Big  business  in  the  U.S.  was  pushing  more  funds  into  the corruption and  cooptation of Black leadership, the building up of a  token  elite as  a  contingency  against  future  Black  revolts.  This corrupting  influence was greatly stepped up during the cold war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Truman  Administration  made  a  rash  of  appointments  of Black  assistants  to  the  department  heads  and  agencies  of  the federal  government.  A  Black  woman,  Mrs.  Edith  Sampson,  was appointed  to the  American  Delegation  to  the  United  Nations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Black  “good  will”  amhassadors were dispatched to the former colonial  nations  of  Asia  and  Africa  to polish  up  the  new  image which  Uncle  Sam  sought  to  present  as  the  champion  of  peace, freedom and democracy.  “Ambassadorial  Uncle Toms,” quipped Earl Brown, a journalist and  later Harlem councilman. According to  Black  leaders,  however,  “integration  was  right  around  the corner/1  These  hopes  were  later  embodied  by  the  NAACP’s slogan,  “Free  by ’63.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Direct  and  imminent  integrationism  was  to  continue  as  the dominant trend through the early stages of the Black Revolt until the rise of the Black power movement in the middle sixties. But the economic  base  of  this  brief  Black  prosperity  was  actually  destroyed with the series of recessions that followed the Korean War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  structural  type  of  unemployment  developed,  the  result  of permanent  destruction of jobs by automation,  rather than merely cyclical  layoffs. The  blow hit Blacks the hardest because they had the lowest seniority having entered industry the latest. The crisis in the cities was aggravated by the farm crisis which thrust a million Black soil tillers upon a shrinking labor market at a time when the skills  they  possessed  were made  obsolete  by the new technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  prelude  to  the  Revolt  of the  sixties, deep  unrest engulfed Black  communities  across the country.  A  small  cloud  no  bigger than  a  man’s  fist,  Elijah  Muhammad’s  Nation  of  Islam,  had already  appeared on the horizon—a harbinger of the great  Black power  nationalist  upsurge  to  come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">INTO THE MAINSTREAM</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite such ominous  portents,  the right reformist tendency in the Party continued to gather strength in its attempt to subvert and overthrow our revolutionary position. It began at first covertly, as a  sneak  attack  by  the  liberal  integrationists  like  Jackson  and Dennis,  who  formed  the  controlling  group  on  the  National Committee.  We  of  the  opposition  found  ourselves  fighting  a defensive  action,  unaware  at  first  that  the  whole  line was  under attack.  We  struggled  locally  in  clubs  and  sections,  hut we were</p>

<p class="calibre1">rapidly  overwhelmed  by  the  integrationists  who  maintained  the upper  hand  at  all  times.  We  were  barred  from  the  press  and all other channels  of inner-Party  communication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  full  scale reformist  offensive  was  kicked  off by  articles  and writings of some leading Black communists, who exaggerated the progressive  role  of  the  NAACP  leadership  in  the  liberation movement.  Such  theories downplayed the need for a fight within the movement for the leadership  of Black workers as a guarantee of the development of a consistent and militant struggle for Black rights.  The  theoiy  for this position was elaborated by Charles T. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mann  (pen  name  for  James  Jackson)  in  his  pamphlet  “Stalin’s Thought  Illustrates  Problems  of Negro  Freedom,”  published  in 1953. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mann characterized the modem national liberation movement of colonial and subject peoples as primarily a “bourgeois effort,” a struggle  of  the  national  bourgeoisie  for  control  of  its  national markets, ratber than a movement of the masses against imperialist oppression. This pamphlet was widely distributed in the Party and was  understood  to  mean  uncritical  acceptance  of  Black  right reformist leadership.  It served as the opening gun in the attack on the  Party’s  Black  and  working  class  cadres,  especially  its  trade unionists, who according to Mann’s position  were “left sectarian” </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  not  accepting  bourgeois  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the Supreme Court decision of 1954 (Brown vs. the Board of Education,  Topeka,  Kansas) outlawing school segregation,  the Party’s pro-integrationist leadership threw all caution to the winds and  went  into  panegyrics  over  the  NAACP  leadership.  The revisionists  unreservedly embraced the pro-imperialist swindle of imminent, peaceful, democratic “integration” of Black people into all  aspects  of American  life under imperialism—dovetailing as  it did with the Party’s  developing theory of peaceful, parliamentary transition  to  socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1956, Ben Davis wrote that “a realistic perspective has opened up  for a  peaceful  and democratic achievement  of the full  social, political  and  economic  equality  of  the  Negro  people  within  the framework  of  our  specific  American  system  and  tradition.”22 </p>

<p class="calibre1">concluded  that  the Jim  Crow  system  was  threatened  with imminent destruction and the Supreme Court decision was the triumph of  the  NAACP’s  policy  of  legal  opposition.  Doxey  Wilkerson hailed Thurgood  Marshall, then a member of the NAACP’s legal staff,  as the  “hero  of the  Supreme  Court  battle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  facts  are  that  this  decision,  historic  in its effect,  was a tactical  concession.  Its  objective  was  to  lull  the  rising  Black movement  at  home,  bolstering  the  faltering  bourgeois  assimilationist leadership and quieting adverse criticism from abroad. Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mordecai Johnson, then  president of Howard University, put this forward  at  the  1954  CIO  convention  in  Cleveland.  Johnson alluded  to  the  fact  that  the  decision  had  been  immediately translated  into  forty  languages.  “One  could  conclude  from  that that the power of world socialism wrested this concession from the American  ruling class  circles,”  he  said.23</p>
<p class="calibre1">During  this  period  the  Party  completely  underestimated  the explosive nature of the Black movement, denying the possibility of a revolutionary  upsurge  of Blacks.  According  to the revisionists, the Black struggle did not have an independent character,  but was simply  an  offshoot  of the  larger  workers’  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  two  years  before  the  bus  boycott  in  Montgomery,  Alabama,  James  Jackson  wrote: “To the  Negro  masses in the  South who have yet to win their elementary democratic right to vote, to remove  the  Jim  Crow  pale  in  the  street  cars,  to  sit  in  the  public parks—such  a  slogan  of  action  would  be  rejected,  considered </p>
<p class="calibre1">^utopian.’  ”24</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the year  of the  boycott,  Jackson  actually  went  so  far as to compare left centers in the Black movement with dual unionism.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">These influential left centers were actually liquidated in the course of  the  general  retreat  of the  rightists.  The  thinking  behind  this policy  was  that  the  NAACP  covered  the  field,  and  there  was no need  for  us  to  intervene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was at this time that the Civil Rights Congress was dissolved, despite  the  militant  mass  campaigns  it  had  waged  on  behalf of Dixie  lynch victims and the impact  of   <i class="calibre4">We Charge Genocide. </i>  The Southern Negro  Youth Congress was allowed to fall apart as early as  1947, when leading Black cadres were assigned to other areas of</p>

<p class="calibre1">work.  The  liquidation  of the  Council  on  African  Affairs,  which was  headed  by  Dr.  DuBois,  Dr.  Alpheus  Hunton  and  Paul Robeson, immediately followed the historic Bandung Conference in  1955.26  <i class="calibre4">Freedom</i>, the sole organ of the left in the Black liberation movement,  was also  closed  down at this time.  By the  mid-fifties, the Party in the South had, for all intents and purposes, once again been  liquidated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  National  Negro  Labor  Councils  (NNLC)  was  the  largest and potentially the most  influential organization dissolved by the Party  in  this  period.  The  NNLC  drew  about  1,000  delegates, mostly  Blacks  from  the  basic  industries,  to  its  first  three  conventions and  led  numerous mass struggles against discrimination on  the job.27</p>
<p class="calibre1">After the war, there were large concentrations of Black workers in auto, steel, the packing houses and other heavy industries. These workers  demanded  leadership  in  the  fight  against  company and union  discrimination.  The  NNLC,  calling  openly  for  unity  between  the  Black  freedom  struggle  and  the  labor  movement, supplied  this  leadership  in  successful  campaigns  to  get  Blacks hired at  Sears  and  many  other  companies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Councils  mobilized  Blacks  and  some  whites  to  oppose the chauvinist  leadership  in  unions like  UAW  Local 600 (Ford’s River  Rouge  plant).  The NNLC was also active in Black communities,  as  in  Louisville,  where their  successful campaign  for jobs showed  a  militant  working  class  alternative  to  the  increasingly conservative NAACP. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the  Black movement surged forward in  1955, it cried out for  Black  working  class  leadership  that  the  CP,  the  NNLC  and <i class="calibre4">Freedom</i>  could  have  provided.  But  the  CP  leadership  united  in opposition  to  everything  that  diverted  the  masses  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“mainstream”  of the  NAACP  and  the  AFL-CIO. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  consolidation  of  this  liquidationist  line,  the  Party leadership  attacked  the  NNLC.  In  June  1956,  Benjamin  Davis openly criticized the work of these councils and said that they had led  to  the “isolation  of many Negro trade union cadres  from the main  body  of the Negro and white workers,” and that  as a result these cadres became “almost powerless to affect the mainstream of</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">organized  lab o r”2H The dissolution of these centers  left a void  in the  movement,  with  many  Party and  non-Party cadres  becoming demoralized,  resigning  from  activity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  as  good  a  sense  of timing as  ever,  A.  Philip  Randolph stepped  into  the  void  that  the  Party  had  left  behind.  In  1960  he founded  the  Negro  American  Labor  Council  (NALC)  with  the intent  of harnessing the militant caucus movement under the firm control  of the  AFL-CIO  bureaucracy.  Randolph,  and  under  his leadership  the  NALC,  refused  to  take  a  firm  stand  against discrimination.  Randolph  openly  stated  at the founding convention  that  discrimination  in  the  unions  was "no  reflection  on  the leadership  of  the  AFL-CIO.”29  At  the  1962  convention,  the councils  failed  to  take  up  the  NAACP  petition  to  tbe  NLRB, which  would  have  had  two  unions  decertified  for  failure  to represent  Black  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rightist line on the Afro-American question was of course a part of the whole rightward drift in the Party.  Under the slogan of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“getting into the mainstream,” the Party attempted to liquidate all left  centers  and  independent  communist  work.  A  number  of articles  were  written  at  that  time,  many  of  them  coming  from underground  leadership,  which  criticized  “purism,”  “self-isolation” and “left sectarianism” in our work, characterizing “leftism” </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  the  main  danger  in the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  December  1952,  the  “Draft  Resolution  on  the  Situation Growing  Out  of  the  Presidential  Elections”  authorized  by  the National Committee stated that “it was  incorrect to have favored departure  of  Wallace  forces  without  the  masses  of  the  Democratic  Party.”30  According  to  the  resolution,  the  major, if </p>
<p class="calibre1">not exclusive, hope for progress was to be found in the Democratic Party.  If  the  masses  of  workers  weren't  ready  to  desert  the Democrats, neither was the CPUS A. This move also signalled the beginning of the destruction of the American Labor Party in New York  State,  where  it  still  maintained  considerable  strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently, the Party lost influence among many progressives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  more mature expression of this revisionist line came with the Draft  Program which appeared in April  1954, a month before the historic Supreme Court decision. The major slogans of action put</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p625"></a><img src="index-625_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  PARTY  WEAKENED  FROM  WITHIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">603</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward in the document called for “A New Congress in 1954” and a  “New  Administration  in  1956”  The  draft  Program  boldly asserted that “what is needed is a new administration which starts to  build  again  where  the  New  Deal  left  o ff”*1</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  document  excluded  all  mention  of  the  right  of  self-determination.  1  questioned  this  at  a  meeting  of  the  program committee  prior  to  the  passage  of the  resolution.  I  asked  Betty Gannett  what  had  happened  to  the  right  of self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why  wasn’t  there  a mention of it in  the Program? True,  we were discussing  the  Party’s  minimal  program  and  self-determination certainly  wouldn’t  be  fully  laid  out  and  explained  in  such  a document.  Yet it was a strategic slogan which, like socialism,  had to  be  mentioned  in  relation  to  the  Party’s  minimal  demands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither  Gannett  nor  Pettis  Perry,  who  was  also  present,  knew what to say.  They didn't seem prepared to discuss the question at the time.  It was at this meeting that l first began to suspect that the leadership  might  once  again  try  to  liquidate  the  right  of  self-determination  and  the  revolutionary  program  for  Black  liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of such open reformism, it isn’t difficult to see why all attempts to  do independent mass work were attacked and  labeled </p>
<p class="calibre1">"left  sectarian.”  I  was  working  in  Harlem  with  my  old  seaman friend,  Josh  Lawrence,  and  his  organizational  secretary,  Pat Lumpkin,  a  very  energetic and  forceful Black woman.  We had  a hell of a figbt with Lil Gates and Blake Charney, New York’s organizational  secretary,  who  tried  to  liquidate  our  work.  We waged  a good  battle  against them,  but  in  the end  very  little was  accomplished. As a result of the internal struggle, we did little mass work, and  this  was  a  general  tendency  in  the  Party  at  the  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  in  this  period  that  all  proposals  for  mass w o rk -in  the mainstream or anywhere else—and any attempt hy communists to play  a  leading  role  were  discouraged,  condemned  and  fought ugainst by the leadership. Those of us who did try to do mass work were  not  helped  or encouraged in any way,  but rather castigated and  beaten down, accused of being “left sectarian,” We were told lo have respect for the bourgeois reformists in the Black liberation movement,  for  the  bureaucrats of the trade union  aristocracy,  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">“lay  off*  and “wait for favorable conditions to arise” for our full participation. Through such policies, the Party increasingly lost its once important roots in the shops,  mills and Black working class communities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the course  of these years I  married Gwen  Midlo.  She was a young Jewish  woman  whom  I had  met earlier in  Paris, when she and  her husband  were both  music students there.  She came from New  Orleans,  where  she  had  been  an  active  member  of  the Southern  Negro  Youth  Congress,  participating  in  the  Wallace campaign,  the  Civil  Rights  Congress  and  many  other  mass campaigns of the Party in the South.  We had political agreement on  the  major  questions  and  in  particular  on the  Black  national question. </p>
