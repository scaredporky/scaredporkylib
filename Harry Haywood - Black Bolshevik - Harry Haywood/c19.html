<p class="calibre1">I  returned  borne  from  Spain  in  the  fall  of  1937.  Soon  after arriving, I heard for the first time the malicious rumors which had preceded  me.  1  was  being  accused  of  leaving  the  front  without permission,  of running away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder's first words to me were, “Harry, had you been a better organizer you wouldn't  have  gotten  into  that  fix.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  had to admit that there was some truth in this. I'd done pretty well in Chicago, but there I had the benefit of collective leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Spain,  a  more  experienced  organizer  would  have  moved cautiously,  not  impulsively as  I had.  He would have made a more careful analysis of the situation, arrived  at an estimate of exactly wbat  could  be  done  and  not  allowed  himself to  be  pushed  into premature  action.  As  a  staff  officer,  I  lived  in  brigade  headquarters,  separately  from  the  men  in  the  trenches.  A  more experienced organizer would have made a greater effort to get out among the  men  and  spend  less  time  at  headquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 had made some mistakes in S paia But I did not feel anything I had done warranted the type of rumor and slander that I was now confronted with. I had led the struggle to improve conditions in the brigade after Jarama. I had made tactical errors in carrying out this struggle,  but  I  expected  and  felt  I  deserved  the  support  of our leading  comrades.  Now  I  found  myself  the  victim  of  a  rumor campaign that  could  only  have started  in  Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  felt  that  at  least  the  brigade leadership,  which  now included</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">491</p>
<p class="calibre1">Steve Nelson and Lawrence, could have explained to the men why and how it was decided that I should leave the front.  But they never did.  Instead,  it  was  left  that  “Harry  Haywood  left  the  front,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">providing fertile soil for rumor  mongering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  in  no  position  to  fight  the  rumors,  however.  First,  I hesitated to bring the whole business out into the open in the midst of the war.  Also, to defend myself would necessitate bringing back to the forefront people and events which had drifted into history as the  bitter  fighting  in  Spain  continued.  Gal  had  been  dismissed from  the  Republican  Army  for  mistakes,  including the  criminal blunders at Jarama;  Nathan was  killed; Cunningham and Aitken repatriated;  Klaus  had  been  transferred  to  the  Thaelmann  Brigade; and only Copic remained of the old leadership.1 The men who survived  Jarama  were  veterans  now.  And  most  significantly, the gross  command  errors  at  Jarama’s  Pingarron  Heights  were  not repeated,  thus  pushing  these  events  into  the  background  where they lost  the  sharp  significance  they  had  while  1  was  in  Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was demoralized  and depressed.  I  had  no other course but to accept  the  decision  to  leave  the  matter in abeyance  until  a  later date.  The rumors,  however,  persisted—undermining my role as a leading Party member and questioning my integrity. At the time 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">saw this slander campaign as an unwarranted attack and, personally,  as  a  tremendous  setback.  Only  years  later was  I  able to see bow this  attack  on a  leading  Black  cadre  was part of the overall thrust  in  the  leadership  of  the  Party  to  liquidate  the  national question  and  our  leading  role  in  the  struggle.  That  is,  the Browdcrite leadership made good use of the political in-fighting in Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sharpest attacks came from James Ford. He lost no time in moving  to  take  advantage  of  my  loss  of  prestige  as  a  result  of Spain.  In  my absence,  Ford  had  continued to  build  his  one-man leadership  of  Afro-American  work.  Under  his  influence,  the Harlem leaders tended to become a closed group; anyone who did not  provide  Ford  with  uncritical support was suspected of being </p>
<p class="calibre1">“anti-leadership.”  As  head  of the  National  Negro  Commission, Ford  tried to extend his style of leadership to the national scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this,  he had tbe active support of Browder who played upon</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p514"></a><img src="index-514_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">492</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ford’s  personal ambitions with uncritical  praise, referring to him as  “the  Frederick  Douglass  of our  time.”  As  a result,  he became one  of Browder’s  key  henchmen.  Ford also continued a vendetta against the older comrades,  which eventually led to the expulsion of Briggs and  Moore.2 Before Spain,  I had sufficient prestige as a leader and theoretician in my own right to resist this tendency. But now with my standing largely eroded  by the difficulties in  Spain, Ford  moved  to  consolidate  his  position  and  oust  me  from leadership  once and for  all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although I  had my differences  with  Ford,  I  did not expect the type of veiled attack  which he launched.  This attack was revealed through  a series  of underhanded  blows. The first was an  article I had  written  as  part  of the  Party’s  pre-convention  discussion  in early  1938. The article, “The White South and the People’s Front,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">was submitted to   <i class="calibre4">The Communist, </i> the Party’s theoretical organ. It was  a  polemic  against  Francis  Franklin,  a  young  Southern intellectual  who  was  at  the  time  the  head  of  the  Fducation Department  of the  YCL. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  published  an  article  in  the January  1938  issue  of   <i class="calibre4">The</i> <i class="calibre4">Communist</i>, “For a  Free,  Happy and Prosperous South,”3 which minimized  the  role  of  revolutionary  Reconstruction  and  made unwarranted concessions to reactionary distortions of the period, particularly concerning the role of the “carpetbaggers.” Under the guise  of winning the  white  Southern  masses  to  our  program,  he distorted  the  revolutionary thrust  of Reconstruction.  His  article was,  in  effect,  an  attack  on  some  of  the  basic  tenets  of  our revolutionary  position.  I  answered  in  my  article  (published  in April  1938) by reasserting our position on the revolutionary role of Reconstruction  and  the  so-called  carpetbag  rule  as  the  most democratic  period  that  the  South  had  ever  known.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">To  my surprise,  I  picked up the April  issue of  <i class="calibre4">The Communist</i> and  saw  that  my  article  had  been  printed just  as  I  wrote  it,  but under  the  name  of Theodore  Bassett.  Bassett  was  one  of James Ford’s  inner  circle  and  educational  director  in  Harlem.  I  approached  V.J.  Jerome   <i class="calibre4">(The  Communist</i> editor) to find  out what had happened. Jerome stated that Ford had insisted that my name be  removed  from  the  article  for  “political  reasons.”  Obviously</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">493</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ford  pirated  this  article  to  prevent  me  from  regaining  any prominence  and  in  order  to  enhance the prestige  of his  Harlem leadership.  He  was  able  to  do  this  by  invoking  my  “Spanish difficulties’*  as  a  reason  for  not  allowing my  name  to  appear  in print. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Tenth Convention of the CPUS A was held in New York in May  1938.  There  I  was  removed  from  the  Politburo  and  the Central Committee. My name was simply omitted from the slate of candidates submitted to  the  convention  by the presiding committee.  Browder was the person who informed me of the move, citing the reason of “mistakes  made in  Spain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After twelve years of being on the Party payroll,  I was suddenly faced with the need to find employment outside. Fora well-known communist,  it  was  not  easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the summer  of  1939,  the  World’s  Fair opened  in  New York City. Isadore Schneider, a left-wing writer and poet, headed up the publicity for the Soviet  pavillion.  He took  me on as his assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  job  was  to  popularize  the  pavillion  among  Blacks  and  to publicize  Soviet  achievement  in  solving  national  and  racial questions.  It  was  an  interesting job.  I  put  advertisements  in  the Black press and organized delegations of prominent  Black leaders to visit the exhibit. We held a press conference of Black editors and invited them to dinner at  the pavillion.  My still fluent knowledge of  Russian  proved  very  useful  and  I  translated  for  the  Soviet guides  when  groups  visited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  wasn’t  long before Ford got  wind of my activities,  however. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  told  me  angrily,  “You  know  you  shouldn’t  have  taken  this job...you’re  too  well  known  a  communist.”  According  to  him, public  relations  should  be  handled  by  a  non-Party  p erso n - </p>
<p class="calibre1">otherwise the effort to puhlieize the exhibit would be narrowed. I certainly didn’t agree with what he had said and told him so. But he insisted that I resign or he would take steps to have me removed. I went to see Schneider and learned that Ford  had already talked to him.  I  had  been  red-baited  before,  but  always  by  the  police  or bourgeois press. Ford had added a new twist! I collected my wages and  left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ford’s vendetta continued through the summer of 1939. As the</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">outbreak  of  world  war  approached,  Japanese  imperialists  were stepping up a propaganda campaign directed at Blacks in the U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Claiming to be the champions of the colored races, they attempted to  use the  national  liberation  movement  of Blacks  for their own purposes  against  their  U.S.  imperialist  rivals,  and to  disrupt  the popular anti-fascist  forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyril  Briggs  and  I  wrote  a  pamphlet  to  counter  this  pro-Japanese  movement  among Blacks.5 This  pamphlet  refuted their spurious propaganda and exposed the Japanese plunder of north China and their imperialist designs for Southeast Asia. The Negro Commission allowed the pamphlet to be published, but only after Ford  had  added  his  name  and  those  of  his  close  associates, Theodore  Bassett  and  Ahner  Berry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the early fall, Jack Stachel, national organizational secretary, called me into his office and asked if I wanted to go to Baltimore to head  up  Afro-American  work  for  the  Maryland  district,  which included  Washington,  D.C. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  welcomed  the  opportunity  to  return  to  work  as  a  Party organizer and saw it as an indication that the personal attacks were coming to an end. Maryland provided a challenging place to work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was the giant Bethlehem Steel plant, Sparrows Point, which had a significant number of Black workers. The drive to organize little  steel  had  suffered  a  defeat  at  the  1937  Memorial  Day Massacre in south Chicago. Now the drive was regaining momentum.  As  one  of  the  largest  eastern  seaports,  the  Baltimore waterfront was a hotbed of activity, lead by the doughty, dynamic and  energetic  Pat  Wbelan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  also  important  Black  liberation  struggles  in  the district.  Baltimore  was  the  scene  of  anti-police  repression  campaigns,  and  the  Eastern  Shore—a  former  slave  hreeding  center and  actually  part  of  the  Black  Belt—was  the  sight  of periodic lynchings  and  frame-ups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stayed about a year hefore the shadow of Spain crept up on me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  my  most  important  tasks  was  organizing  for  the  Third National  Convention  of  the  National  Negro  Congress.  The organizing in preparation for the convention and the meeting itself provided  important  impetus  for  all  the  work in the  district. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">495</p>
<p class="calibre1">John P. Davis, executive secretary of the NNC, asked to borrow some funds for the convention, promising to repay us as soon as it was  over.  I  supported  this  request and  we  lent  the NNC  money from  district  funds.  But  Davis  was  unable to  repay  us as he  had promised.  Fields, tbe district organizer, took exception to this and we clashed  sharply.  Before the situation could be resolved, Fields went to the national office without my knowledge.  He was able to convince  them  that  1  was  not  needed  in the  district.  I  was  soon withdrawn,  returning to New  York  in  the  fall  of  1939. </p>
<p class="calibre1">World  War  II,  with  its  beginning  in  the  fascist  invasion  of Ethiopia,  China  and  Spain,  broke  out  in  earnest  with  Hitler’s lightning conquest  of Poland in September  1939.  The imperialist governments  of  France,  Great  Britain  and  the  U.S.,  which  had been following a policy of appeasement towards the building up of the  German  war  machine  in  the  hopes  of  using  it  in  an  armed invasion  of the  Soviet  Union,  now found themselves threatened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  schemes  against  the  Soviets  had  been  shaken  by the  nonaggression  pact  signed  hy  the  Soviets  with  Germany  in  August 1939. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Soviet  policy  had  consistently  urged joint  action against fascist  aggression,  but  the  capitalist  governments  were  not  interested.  The  Soviets  offered  to  defend  Czechoslovakia,  but  the French  refused  to  put  their  mutual  defense  pact  into  effect.  The Soviets  offered  to  defend  Poland  on  the  eve  of  the  German invasion, but Poland refused to allow the Red Army units to cross the  border.  The  British  stubbornly  refused  any  type  of mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union, hoping all the time for war between  Germany  and  Russia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Soviets thus  moved  to  defend  themselves  and  thwart this imperialist  scheme,  signing  the  non-aggression  pact  with  Germany—a  brilliant  and  necessary diplomatic  move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the fact that France and  Britain  were pledged to assist Poland, they did  nothing in response to Hitler’s invasion.  For six months,  neither side made a military move against the other.  This period, the “phony war,” was used by the western imperialists in a final  attempt  to  turn the war  against  the  Soviets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  November  30,  1939,  war  broke  out  between  the  Soviet</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Union  and  Finland  The immediate  cause  was  German-inspired Finnish  incursions  into  Soviet  territory,  greatly  encouraged  and fostered  by  attempts  by  the  British  and  French  to  foment  war against  the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Hitler  had  his  own  plan.  Realizing  the  impossibility  of waging war on both eastern and western fronts, he moved against the  weaker  opponents.  In  April  1940,  German  troops  marched into  Denmark and Norway.  Finland proved the utter bankruptcy of British and  French  policy  by allying itself with the fascists. On May 28, the supposedly invincible armies of France were defeated and  the  British  were  driven  into  the  sea  at  Dunkirk.  In  rapid succession,  the  countries  of  western  Europe  came  under  Nazi control.  Thus  satisfied  that  his  western front  was secure and  not considering the British a serious threat to his rear. Hitler turned his attention eastward.  Viciously  occupying Yugoslavia, Greece and Albania, and  bringing Bulgaria into the war as a fascist ally, Hitler overran  the  Balkans  and  prepared  for  his  decisive  blow  of  the war—the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The initial stage of the war (September 1939 to June  1941) was dominated  by  the  imperialist  powers  and  was  a  war  for  world domination.  Our policy called  for active support of China and all oppressed  peoples  in  their  struggles  against  fascism  and  for national  independence.  It  called  for ending the war as  rapidly as possible on the basis of a democratic peace. Our main slogan was </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep  America  out  of the imperialist  war!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great  sentiment  for peace was reflected  in the positions  of both the AFL and the CIO which went on record as opposing U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">participation  in  the  war.  United  front  organizations  such as  the NNC,  the  Southern  Congress  for  Human  Welfare  and  others adopted similar  positions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably  the  largest  of  the  many  peace  activities  was  the American  Peace  Mobilization, formed  in Chicago on  August  31, 1940.  It  consisted  of  over  6,000  delegates  representing  about 12,000,000 people in trade unions,  youth organizations,  women’s clubs  and  Black  groups.  Under  the  banner  of  “For  a  People’s Peace,**  it  fought  against  further  extension  of the  war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  October  1939,  a  few  weeks  after  the  fascist  conquest  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">497</p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland,  I  found  myself in  the  Veteran’s  Hospital at  Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx. I suffered a serious heart attack. My condition was found  to  be service connected; the result of the endocarditis I had suffered  while in  the Army during the First  World War. This time the  diagnosis  was valvular heart disease. I  was awarded full compensation,  one  hundred  dollars  per  month,  by  the Veterans’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Administration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">R  &amp;R  IN  THE  SAN  FERNANDO  VALLEY</p>
<p class="calibre1">After  three  months’  recuperation,  I  was  released  from  the hospital  and advised to take a long rest.  Thinking that I might be incapacitated for life, I decided togo to Los Angeles, arriving there in the winter of 1940.1 rented a small bungalow on the property of a  comrade  in  the  San  Fernando  Valley  and  stayed  there  over a year.  It  was  on  Van  Nuys  Road  near  the  Pacoima  Reservoir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  stay  was  very  restful  and  I  became  a  member  of  the Southern California  District of the Party. There was a good Party organization  in  the  valley  and  a  relatively  large  circle  of sympathizers.  The comrades  were very  solicitous  towards  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  Party  branch  actively  organized  in  the  valley  for  tbe American  Peace  Mohilization and we were able to send a  strong delegation  to  Chicago  as  part  of  the  Los  Angeles  contingent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although still recuperating, I helped with this work by givingtalks and  leading  discussions  on  the  international  situation  and  the progress  of the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was in California that I met an old comrade, Belle Lewis, who had  also come  from  the east  to recuperate from an illness.  I  was bappy  to  see  her  again,  having known her  back  east  during  the National Miners Strike of 1931. She was a veteran communist and organizer for the National  Miners  Strike Relief Organization in </p>
<p class="calibre1">“bloody**  Harlan  County.  During the  strike,  she  had  been jailed along with  five other women who were framed  up and known  as the  Kentucky  Six.  Later she was  a  section  organizer in Boston’s Black  ghetto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belle  was  a  handsome,  warm-hearted  woman  in  her  early</p>

<p class="calibre1">thirties.  She had Slavic features, with a broad face and high cheek bones.  We  were  both lonely and  struck it  off quite well together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She came to live with me in  the valley and  later we were formally married.  Our  union  was  to  last  fifteen years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On June 22,  1941, Hitler launched his attack against the Soviet Union.  This  fateful action dramatically changed  the character of the war and was in fact, the beginning of the end for Hitler. Hitler’s armies  marched  deep  into  the  Soviet  Union,  but  in  the winter of 1941-42  the  heroic  effort  of  the  Russian  people  stopped  the German  offensive  at  Leningrad  and  Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  regrouped  German army launched  another offensive in  the spring of 1942, aimed at Stalingrad. For months the city was under siege,  but  the powerful Germans could  not take the city. The epic Battle of Stalingrad was ended January 31,1943, with the decisive defeat  of Hitler’s  crack  Sixth  Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  invasion  of  the  Soviet  Union,  our  Party’s  policy towards  the  war  changed.  It  was  no longer possible  to limit  tbe spread  of the war; it was now a  people’s war aimed at the defeat of fascism.  The bombing of Pearl  Harbor ended  any lingering hope that  America  could  stay  out  of  the  war.  Our  slogans  became, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything  for  National  Unity!” and  “Everything  for  Victory!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  time  Hitler  hurled  bis  war  machine  against  the  Soviet Union, my health  had improved and I was feeling as good as ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belle  and  I  decided  to  move  into  L,A.  proper and  become more active  in  Party  affairs.  Browder  had  sent  a  letter  to  tbe district secretary,  Carl Winter, to the effect that the Spanish incident was not to be held  against me and I  was to be given an opportunity to make my contributions to the Party,  Pettis  Perry was at  the time head  of Afro-American  work  in  the  district. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although I  wasn’t aware of it at the time, in hindsight  it’s clear that under Browder’s leadership  Ford had already set on a course which  was  to  lead  to  the liquidation of the Party’s revolutionary position  on  the  Black  national  question.  The Party  had  already dissolved  the  Sharecroppers  Union  and,  under  the  pretext  of building the united front, was slurring over the special demands of Blacks  in  all  its  areas  of work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party’s correct  position  for consolidating the united front, </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">499</p>
<p class="calibre1">the declaration  of national  unity  under  the slogans, “Everything for  the  war  effort!”  and “Everything for  victory over worldwide fascist  slavery!”  was  however  accompanied  by  a  serious  undermining  of  the  Party’s  leading  role  and  its  ideological  strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tendency to subordinate the class struggle to Roosevelt’s New Deal  policy  had  manifested  itself earlier in  the liquidation  of the Party’s  factory units,  shop  papers  and  trade  union  fractions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">/'Now this tendency was revealing itself in distortions of the nostrike  pledge and  hiding  the face of the Party.  Belle brought  this home to me in  regards to her work in a war industry plant in Los Angeles. She was very dissatisfied and angry because according to the  line  she  was  supposed  to  remain  in  the  background— </p>
<p class="calibre1">promoting non-Party people for union leadership.  In many cases, and  her  plant  was  a  good  example,  the  no-strike  pledge  was interpreted  to  mean  little,  if  any,  struggle  around  working conditions or safety. The Party demanded virtually no concessions from the factory owners in return for the guarantee that workers would  not  strike during the course  of the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A similar tendency of slurring over the special demands of Blacks had  begun to creep into the work. An example of this was the fact that despite the active role the Party played in the struggle for the FEPC (an executive order to outlaw discrimination against Blacks in war industries), it found itself tailing the NAACP and A. Philip Randolph when it  came to  organizing support  for the  measure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I saw these tendencies as deviations or individual mistakes which would be corrected—not as symptoms of a developing opportunist line,  a  pattern  of  abdicating  the  leading  role  of  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhat divorced from the struggle going on in the Party, Belle and  I  moved  into  .an  apartment  on  Forty-second  Street  and Crocker in  the Central Avenue district, the heart of Los Angeles’s Black ghetto. We immediately got to work, and in no time  we were able to build up a  Party  branch of about fifty Blacks, some of the finest  young people I have  ever met.  Most were from Oklahoma, Arkansas,  Texas  and  Louisiana—part  of  the  first  wave  of migrations  to the new war industries in and  around  Los Angeles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The branch secretary was one of the local people, with Belle as membership  director  and  myself as  education director.  We  held</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">discussions and meetings on national and international problems, as  well as  questions  confronting  the community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were elated  with  our  success,  but  it  was not shared by the district office downtown.  Pettis Perry had tried to direct the Afro-American work from his  office, rather than establishing a base in the  community.  The work  obviously suffered from this  isolation and  he was jealous of our success.  Our house was always open to comrades  and  quickly  became  a  center for activity  in  the  area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t long before we hegan hearing rumors which referred to Belle  and  myself as  the  “uptown  braintrust”  and  accused  us  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“establishing a second center.” Angered and fed up with those false charges, covert accusations and  innuendos, I decided to get a job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  my  health  seemed  excellent,  I  was  wary  of my  heart condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I went to the state rehabilitation office for a check-up to sec if I was  fit  to  work.  To  my  surprise,  L passed the  examination  with flying colors.  The examining doctor told me my heart was in good condition and he saw no reason why I couldn’t do anything I  had done  before.  Encouraged,  I  asked  if I  could  go  to  sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,  but  I  wouldn’t  advise  you  to  be  anything  like  a stevedore,” he said. Still, 1 was told I was unable to join the Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SIGNING  UP  WITH  THE  NMU</p>
<p class="calibre1">In June  1943,  I enlisted as a seaman in the Merchant Marine at San  Pedro,  California,  the  port  of Los  Angeles.  Just as millions around the world, I wanted to make some contribution to the fight against  fascism.  I  knew  the  history  of struggle  of  the  National Maritime  Union  and  had  long  been  an  admirer  of the  militant seamen’s  union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  NMU  was  the  largest  of  all  seamen’s  unioas,  reaching  a membership  of about  100,000 during the war.  Its forerunner had been  the  Marine  Workers  Industrial  Union,  organized  hy  the the  SIU  (an  AFL-dominatcd seaman’s union).  The TUUL  union dissolved and sent its membership into the SIU. They later helped to lead the rank-and-file revolt against the bureaucratic leadership</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p523"></a><img src="index-523_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">501</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the SIU.  This revolt led to the founding of the NMU as a CIO </p>
<p class="calibre1">union  in  1936.  Its  history  was  marked  by  bloody strikes  in  1936 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  1937  in  which  several  members  were  killed  by  thugs  and police. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through  this  fierce  struggle  and  with  the  Party’s  co.rrcct leadership,  the NMU  became one of the most militant, dedicated and  highly  organized  of all the CIO unions. The union was in the leadership of the anti-fascist movement both at home and abroad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  actively  supported  the  anti-lynch  bill,  demanded  full  employment  and  a  permanent  FEPC.  When  Italian  fascists  invaded Ethiopia,  NMU  seamen  refused  to  sail  ships  to  Italy.  Later they refused to sail steel-laden ships and tankers for Japan. In the midst of very  important  union  struggles,  some 800 union members left their pieketlines for Spain.  Over 200 died in the attempt to defeat the  fascist  offensive  and  prevent  a  new  world  war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NMU  seamen  were  known  as  worldwide  emissaries  of labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  would  contact  local  unions wherever they docked,  offering assistance  and  support and  often  participating  in  labor  marches and  demonstrations.6</p>
<p class="calibre1">As head of the Party’s Afro-American work, I had known many of the old-timers in the SIU and had worked with some of the men who helped to found the NMU. These included A1 Lannon, Patty Whelan,  Tom  Ray,  Johnny  Rogan,  Hurscl  Alexander,  Roy Hudson, George Mink, Josh Lawrence and Ferdinand Smith. The latter two were Blacks and both were on the national board of the union.  Smith  became  the  national  secretary  and  Josh,  a  boatswain,  became  port  agent  for the  Great  Lakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few days after I enlisted, I signed on the Union Oil Company’s tanker,  <i class="calibre4">Im   Placentia</i>.  1  had  no  training  besides  as  a  waiter so I chose  the job  of crew  messman,  serving  the  crew  at  meals  and cleaning up.  I  was the only  Black  in the crew.  We were bound for Pearl  Harbor and Honolulu. Our tanker served as mothership for a  dozen  or  so  PT  boats  on  their  way  to  the  Pacific  war  zone, refueling them on the voyage across and relying on them to serveas our escort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  boats (patrol torpedo craft) were small, fast and  heavily armed.  They  carried  a  minimal  crew  of three officers and  eleven</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p524"></a><img src="index-524_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">502</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">men.  Armed  with  four  torpedos,  two  rocket  launchers,  twenty millimeter anti-aircraft  guns,  thirty-seven millimeter cannon and fifty  caliber machine  guns,  PT  boats were pound-for-pound  the most  heavily  armed  ships  in  the  war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  months  following  Pearl  Harbor,  the Japanese met with almost fantastic success in the Pacific and south Asia, despite the fact that their finest force,  the Quantung Army, was tied down in north  and  east  China  by  the  armies  of  Russia  and  China. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  May  1942,  most  of the major islands in the south  Pacific had fallen to Japan,  cither wholly  or  in  part.  Bangkok,  Hong Kong, Java,  Wake, Guam and the Philippines were among the territories incorporated  into Japan's “co-prosperity”  empire.  Australia was threatened with invasion from the north;  Darwin, a northern port city,  had  already been attacked  by the  Imperial Air  Force.  When Burma fell to the Japanese, land supply routes to embattled China were effectively cut and Japan had a base from whiebto launch an invasion  of India. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t until  May 1942, at the battle of the Coral Sea, that the Japanese  met  their  first  big  setback.  It  was  here that  they  were prevented  from taking Port  Moresby,  Papua, and possibly invading Australia.  In the next few months, they suffered major defeats at  Midway and  Guadalcanal.  As  we  headed  into the  Pacific war zone,  ten  months  after Guadalcanal,  the allies were  preparing to launch  their major  offensive  in  the  south  Pacific. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After two weeks at sea, we landed at Pearl Harbor. In December 1941,  it  had  been  the  scene  of the  massive Japanese raid  on  the Pacific fleet. Now, a year and a half later, the wreckage of Admiral Kimmel’s once proud fleet was strewn over the harbor. Thousands of victims  still  lay in  the  hulls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I went ashore with some shipmates. We took a bus to Honolulu, a  few  miles  away.  I  found  war-time  Honolulu  pretty  drab.  The streets,  busses  and  amusement  places  were  crowded  with  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">military and naval  personnel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  went  into  a  bar  on  Bishop  Street in  downtown  Honolulu and  the  white  bartender-proprietor  refused  to  serve  me.  He apologetically said that he had nothing against Blacks personally, but that  there  had  been  a  bloody  fight  between  Black and  white</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p525"></a><img src="index-525_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">503</p>
<p class="calibre1">soldiers there just a week before.  For that reason he had decided not  to serve Blacks at all.  My white shipmates started to protest, but I said, “Aw, come on, don’t bother.” It wasn’t worth the hassle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We just walked  out  and  went  to  another  har. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Marines  and  the  Navy,  serving  as  Shore  Patrol  in  Pearl Harhor at the time, were generally arrogant and belligerent toward us  civilian  seamen.  They  called  us draft  dodgers,  dollar  chasers, reds and  slackers.  We had  to swallow  hard and just take it.  If we fought  back,  we’d  be  thrown  in  the  brig  where  we’d  suffer even more  abuse.  We  developed  a  real  hatred  for  the  Navy  and  the Marines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  hostility  and  the  racism  the  military  had  brought  over with it tended to sour my impressions of Hawaii I had no regrets when, in a couple days we were on our way back to San Pedro. We returned without  escort,  having left the PT boats at Pearl  Harbor to supplement  the  allies’  Pacific  fleet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two  weeks  later  we  left  San  Pedro  again,  retracing  our  last voyage  back  to  Hawaii  By this time,  the  allies were engaged  in fierce  battles  to  retake  the Japanese-occupied territories on New Guinea  and the  Solomon Islands.  In six  months,  as the result of these and  later actions, Japan’s eastern front would be wide open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  brought  with  us  another  escort  of  PT  hoats.  Again  we dropped  the  PT  boats at  Pearl  Harhor,  but  this time we headed southwest  to  Pago  Pago  in  the  American  Samoas.  It  was  not  a busy port,  we  were the  only  ship  in  the harhor. The Polynesians there were among the friendliest people I  had ever met. They had light brown skin and looked like any mulatto that one might see on the  streets  of  Harlem  or  Chicago’s  Southside.  Families  would invite  us  to  visit  their homes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  next  port  was  Noumea,  New  Caledonia,  a  French  possession about 800 miles east of Australia which had formerly been a penal  colony.  The New Caledonians were Melanesians,  big fine looking Blacks with wooly hair.  My interest in anthropology had led me to read extensively about these “Asian Negroes” and I was glad  to  have  the  opportunity to  meet  them  first  hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  about  ten  days there,  discharging our fuel  and  refueling small  naval  craft coming in from  the Solomons, we finally sailed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p526"></a><img src="index-526_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">504</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">out  past  the  coral  reefs  and  were  on  our  way  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, merchant ships were more heavily armed than they had  been  earlier  in  the  war.  Our  tanker  mounted two three-inch cannons,  fore  and  aft,  and  several twenty-millimeter rapid  firing Swiss anti-aircraft guns. On our ship these guns were manned by a Navy gun crew of eighteen men commanded by a lieutenant junior grade. We merchant seamen performed a vital support role for the armed guard detachment. I served as assistant loader on one of the anti-aircraft  guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the early morning, about two days out of Noumea, a general alarm was sounded.  An unidentified ship had been sighted on the horizon off the port bow. We all rushed to our battle stations and waited.  In  wartime,  we  had  to  maintain  radio  silence  to  avoid disclosing  our  position.  We  waited  for  the  ship  to  come  close enough to identify it.  We knew we wouldn’t have a chance against a Japanese warship;  it would  have blown  us  out of the water.  We were  all  relieved  when  the alarm was finally called  off, the vessel had  been  identified  as  the  U.S.  troop  ship   <i class="calibre4">West  Point. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Back  home  after a couple of weeks in  Los Angeles, we got  the news that a big troop ship was crewing up in San  Pedro. It was the <i class="calibre4">Uruguay</i>, a former luxury liner on the New York-Buenos Aires run that  had  been  leased  to the military by Moo re-McCormack lines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  had  now  been  converted  into  a  troop  ship  and  had  been carrying  troops  from  the  east  coast  to  Oran  and  other  ports  in north  Africa,  Now she had come through the Panama Canal and around  to the  west  coast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scuttlebutt  had  it  that  she  was  now to transport troops  to  the Pacific  war  zone.  When  they  got  the  news  that  she  was  being transferred to the Pacific,  half the original crew had  gotten off in New  York.  She  made the New  York to San  Pedro  run with only half of her 450-man crew. She was carrying no troops at the time so it  posed  no  big  problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">San  Pedro  was  mainly a  freighter and  tanker  port,  supplying crews of between forty and sixty. The NMU local was hard put for men  to  fill  out  the   <i class="calibre4">Uruguay's</i>  large  crew  and  for  the  new  crew ratings  required for a large troop transport. The local had to send to  San  Francisco  to  help  fill  out  the  crew. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p527"></a><img src="index-527_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">505</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  NMU  port  agent  in  San  Pedro  at  the  time  was  Oliver Bout6e, a  progressive minded Black from New Orleans. The chief union  patrolman  - the  number one  port  union official  under the port  agent—was  Neil  Crow,  a tough  experienced  seaman  and  a well-respected  communist.  The  union  was  determined  to  put together  the  best  possible  crew  for  the   <i class="calibre4">Uruguay</i>  and  started  by lining up a solid nucleus of good union seamen. One reason for the special effort was the rumors of racketeering aboard the  <i class="calibre4">Uruguay</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  good  opportunity  to  clean  up  the  ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Racketeering  on  hoard  ships—mainly  gambling  and  selling illegal  liquor  to  troops—was  a  crucial  issue  for  the  National Maritime  Union.  It  was  a  matter of  principle—the  honor  of the union was at stake. In spite of the NMU’s hundred percent hacking of  the  war  effort,  merchant  seamen  were  often the  target  of the kind of slanderous remarks 1  have already mentioned.  Shiphoard racketeering  played  into  these slanders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Racketeering also prevented the union from handling legitimate </p>
<p class="calibre1">“beefs" about ship conditions. It divided the crew against itself and made it difficult to wage effective struggles to improve intolerable conditions; crowded and inadequately ventilated quarters, unsanitary  heads,  poor food and arbitrary  disciplinary treatment from officers.  Shipboard racketeers were strongly anti-union, undoubtedly  often  the  result  of deals  made  with  the  officers  to  look  the other way from the rackets.  Having never worked on a big ship, I was, at the time, only dimly aware of these problems and what they meant  for  the  union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ROUNDING THE CAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  day  arrived  to  crew up the   <i class="calibre4">Uruguay t</i>  the hiring hall was  crowded.  I  recognized some familiar faces.  Red Herrick was there,  a veteran communist seaman  and artist who had  made the maiden  voyage  on  the   <i class="calibre4">Booker  T.  Washington. </i>  The   <i class="calibre4">Washington</i> was the first merchant  ship to be commanded by a Black captain, Hugh  Mulzac.  Red was a fireman on the ship.  I  was surprised to see Hursel Alexander, a well-known Black communist leader from</p>

<p class="calibre1">506</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Los  Angeles who  had  never  sailed  before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stood in the crowded union hall, reading the long list of ratings that  had  to  he  filled.  There  were  openings  for  cooks,  hakers, waiters, pantrymen, utilitymen and others in the stewards’ department.  I  knew  my  skills  were  limited,  but  I  had  no desire to take another  messman job.  Neil  Crow  approached  me and said, “We really  want  you  on  that  ship,  Harry.  Take the chief pantryman’s job,”  he  told  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  hesitated,  wondering  why the job was  posted when the third and fourth pantryman jobs were not. Why hadn’t anyone from the old crew wanted to move up to chief pantryman? I didn’t know if I was  qualified;  the job would  put  me in  charge of about  ten  men, responsible for preparing salads and hors cToeuvres, setting up and serving  at  steam  tables  and  making  beverages,  coffee,  tea  and desserts  for 400-500  officers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several friends  of mine standing nearby also urged me to take the job.  A  young man  whom  I  had just  met  in  the hall,  Herbert Jeffries,  said,  “HI  support  you,  Harry.  I’ll  throw  in  my  card  for first  pantryman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  promise  of  their  support,  I  agreed.  When  the dispatcher called  out,  “chief pantryman,”  I  stepped forward  and threw  in  my card.  No  one else applied; there was no contest. I felt uneasy  all  over  again,  but  I  had  the joh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon  boarding  ship,  my  ability  to  perform  the  chief  pantryman’s  job  was  immediately  challenged  hy  the  chef.  He  was  an Argentinian, an old chef from the   <i class="calibre4">Uruguay's</i> days as a luxury liner, and  a  rabid  white  chauvinist.  When  he saw  me  he scowled:  “So you’re the  chief pantryman!”  I  said  I  was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, make me up four gallons of French dressing, four gallons of thousand  island,  four gallons  of Russian dressing,  a gallon  of tartar  sauce  and  four  gallons  of mayonnaise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  clearly  a  challenge  to  my  ability,  especially  making mayonnaise  from  scratch.  I  was  taken  aback  because  I’d  never done it before. I sought out Jeffries, who had promised to hack me up,  but he didn’t  know how to make mayonnaise either.  Fortunately  the  second  pantryman,  a  Swede,  stepped  in  and  saved  the day,  I passed the chefs “test” to his great disappointment and had</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">507</p>
<p class="calibre1">no more  problems  of this  type  during the voyage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We left San Pedro on  November 9,  1943,  bound for the South Pacific  and  eventually  Bombay,  India.  Approximately  5,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">troops  were  on  board.  In  contrast  to  the   <i class="calibre4">La  Placentia</i>,  a  large portion  of   <i class="calibre4">Uruguay's</i> crew was  Black, especially  in the stewards’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">department.  On  the  first  day  out  we  organized  a  union  ship committee  which  consisted  of  one  delegate  and  an  alternate delegate  from  each  department—deck,  engine  and  steward.  A meeting of the crew was called and  Red  Herrick was elected  ship chairman.  The meeting was general,  a statement of union principles was made, the need for a clean ship emphasized and every man urged  to  do  his  job.  There  was  no  controversy  and  it  was uneventful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two or three days out, however, racketeering became  <i class="calibre4">the</i> issue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My third and fourth pantrymen were arrested by the ship military police and charged with selling liquor to the soldiers. The military poliee  had  raided  their  bunkrooms  and  found  the  bulkheads packed  with  cases  of  liquor,  a  virtual  warehouse  of  smuggled booze.  How  did  they  get  all  that  contraband  aboard,  1  wondered?  Obviously  these  men  had  connections  with  shoreside gangsters.  They  were  put  in  the  brig  for  the  remainder  of the three month voyage. Now it was clear to me why these men had not put in for the chief pantryman’s job. They didn’t need the extra pay  and  didn’t  want  the extra  responsibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  this was  not  all. The ship  was swarming with a number  of rackets. There was a cigarette racket, controlled by a storeman  He smuggled  aboard entire cases of cigarettes and, when  we reached Bombay, sold  them at fantastic profits.  But the greatest  of all the rackets  was  the nigbtly crap and  poker games.  They were run  by two glory hole (crews’ quarters) stewards, the lowest rating on the ship.  The  stewards  were  big-time professional  gamblers and  had the  entire  operation  well  organized.  They  were  surrounded  by toad ies and  sycophants who covered their jobs for them and even served them special food and the hest scotch while they lay around all  day in  their  bunks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  men  and  their  circle  of  cronies  were  corrupting  a significant section of the crew and represented the main obstacle to</p>

<p class="calibre1">508</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">any  united  action  to  improve  conditions  on  the  ship.  In  ship meetings they always were the greatest patriots and red-baited the union, warning against communists that were out to “disrupt” the ship.  We  struggled  against  these phonies  during the  entire  three month voyage and after several tense incidents  were finally able to isolate  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our first port of call was Hobart, Tasmania, an island southeast of Australia  on  the  Tasman  Sea.  A  few days before arriving,  we picked up two Army transports which continued sailing with us all the  way  to  Bombay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  stay  was  short,  only  twenty-four  hours,  but  a  welcome break  after  the  long,  lonely  Pacific  crossing.  Hobart,  a  very pleasant  town,  was  a  resort  and  vacation  area  for  Australians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving Hobart, we stood  for Freemantle, the port of Perth on the  west  coast  of Australia,  sailing  the  rough  seas  of the  Great Australian Bight. In Perth, I had my first impressions of Australia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seemed a white man’s country to me then—I never saw any of the native  inhabitants—but  strangely  I  felt  no  antagonism.  On  the contrary,  everyone  was  very  friendly  toward  us  Black  seamen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wc  were  aware  of  the  immigration  bar  against  Asians  and Blacks  which  was  rigidly  enforced.  When  asked  about  this,  the Aussies  assured  us  it  wasn’t  a racist law  ~“It’s got  nothing to  do with you  guys...and  certainly we’re  friendly  with  the  Chinese.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought to myself, “Well they should be, for the Chinese were a major factor in preventing a Japanese fascist invasion of Australia by  pinning  down  Japan’s  main  armies  in  north  China.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They told us, “It’s a  law brought in by the labor government to prevent  Australian  capitalists  from  importing  coolie  labor  and undercutting  the  white  Australian  workers.”  The  irony  of  this explanation  didn’t even  occur to  the  Australians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  found  ourselves  warmly  greeted  as  we  went  sightseeing through the city of Perth. Several members of an Australian artillery  regiment  invited  us  to “bring all  our  friends”  and come to a dance that night at their barracks just  outside of Freemantle.  We turned  out in  large numbers  and were waltzing Matildasf all night long. It was a great party and didn’t break up until nearly daylight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  we  sailed  several  days  later,  we  bid  them  all  goodbye. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">509</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were glad to see the two Dutch cruisers that would escort us to  Bombay.  We  felt  these  were  particularly  hostile  waters  since much  of  the  territory  on  the  coast  of  the  Bay  of  Bengal  was occupied  by  the  Japanese,  as  were  the  Andaman  Islands  some 1,800  miles  east  of  India.  Even  now,  as  we  sailed  through  the Indian Ocean with  our “cargo’1 of U.S. troops bound for Bombay, the Japanese  were  massing  their forces  in  Burma  preparatory to invading eastern  India. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Six weeks out of San Pedro, we docked in Bombay. I wanted to find  the  Communist  Party  headquarters  to  see  if  it  would  be possible to meet with some of the Indian comrades I had known at KUTVA. This proved to be a simple task.  I asked a longshoreman who  gave  me  directions  to  the  Party  headquarters.  Several comrades,  Hursel  Alexander,  Red  Herrick and I went downtown and found the Party headquarters. It was an impressive four or five story building on a main street, a red flag with hammer and sickle flying from  its  roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking in, we identified ourselves to the first person we saw— a young  man  who  turned  out  to  be  a  member  of  the  Central Committee of the Indian Party. I explained that we were American communists and that 1 was interested in seeing some of the Indians I had known in Moscow.  I didn't know their real names, but I gave the  young  man  several  descriptions.  He  asked  what  years  I  had been  in  Moscow.  When  I  said  1926-30,  his  face  showed  real interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” he said, “I think something can be arranged. Why don't you  and  your  friends  come  hack  here  at  about  six  o'clock  for dinner?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hursel,  myself and  several  others came back that evening and went upstairs. We took our shoes off in the hall as was the custom; and entered in our stocking feet. There they were,  my old friends from  Moscow.  Nada,  a  beautiful  Indian  woman,  rushed  to embrace  me.  There  was  Sakorov,  my  old  roommate  and  close friend,  one of the founders of the Indian C,P.  He told me he was now on the Cent ral Committee and was Party representative to the National  Indian  Congress  for the  Bombay  District. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was also Patel, who had  toured the United States before</p>

<p class="calibre1">the war as a representative of Indian students.  His tour had  been sponsored  by  the  American  Youth  Congress.  He  was  now Communist  Party district  organizer for Bomhay. There were also several  of the  old  Sikhs  who  grabbed  me,  “Harry!  Harry!”  My friends  sat  u$  down  and  wc  all  ate  and  swapped  tales  about  old times and about the political situation in our respective countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nada was  now president of the Bombay chapter of the Friends of  the  Soviet  Union.  Before,  she  had  been  a  nationally  known communist youth leader. She invited us to come visit a group at the University  of  Bombay.  The  next  day  we  met  with  a  bunch  of young students  there  and  talked  politics  over cups of Indian tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our troops disemharked at Bomhay and after about six days we pulled  out  of  the  harbor  with  a  very  light  load;  a  handful  of passengers,  a  few military hospital  patients and some diplomatic types.  We headed for Capetown, sailing down through the Indian Ocean  ever  watchful  for  Japanese  submarines  which  had  been reported  off  Madagascar.  As  we  neared  Capetown,  a  notice appeared  on the ship's bulletin board, something to the effect that </p>
<p class="calibre1">“the  people  of South  Africa  have certain  customs and  laws as to race.  While  they  are  not  ours,  we  should  all  respect  them, remember  wc  are  in  their  country and  don’t  start  any trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  bunch of us, about half Black and half white, got off the ship together and  went straight into a dockside bar. No sooner did we get  in  than  the  bartender  started  yelling,  “Now  wait  a  minute, fellows,  the  Blacks  over  here  and  the  whites  over  there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of our white shipmates started to protest,  but we Blacks said, “What the hell, we want a drink, man. We know this is South Africa.  Damn it, you know we can’t fight this thing now—let's get a  drink.”  We  settled  for salutes  across  tbe  bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  went  up to the Sixth  District, Capetown's  Black  ghetto,  with some of my Black shipmates.  I  was never so depressed in my life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The oppression of the people was complete. I’d seen nothing like it, even in “darkest  Mississippi.” There Blacks at least had some kind of cultural institutions—churches, lodges and so forth.  Here they had nothing. They had been forced from the land and pushed into oppressive native “reserves.” These reserves in turn served as labor reservoirs for the city, where blacks were crowded into ghettos and</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">5J1</p>
<p class="calibre1">their tribal structures and institutions completely destroyed. Their culture had  been stolen from them.  Whites were warned not to go into the area after dark,  as a number of whites had been murdered there.  This  seemed  like  a  kind  of spontaneous  rebellion  to  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  1  walked down the street,  I  heard  two Blacks speaking in a strange and  beautiful  language.  I stopped and asked them what it was.  They  answered  in  perfect  English  that  it  was  Xhosa,  their tribal  language.  It  sounded  almost  musical  to  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back  downtown,  I  went  into  a  restaurant for  natives,  but the white  owner  refused  to  serve  me.  44 But  Tm  Black,”  I  protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">44Yeah,  hut  you’re  not  one  of ours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  made my way to the Communist Party headquarters and was surprised  to  find  that  like  in  Bombay,  it  was  located  on  a  main street downtown. There was a young white woman at the office to whom I introduced myself. She seemed to recognize my name. She was the wife of an Indian member of the Central Committee. She said, “It’s so unfortunate that you came through at this particular time.  All  the  Central Committee people are in  Jo’burg.  There’s  a big  plenum  going  on  this  weekend.  I’m  sure  my  husband  and others  would  have  liked  to  have  met  you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  asked  about  some  of  the  South  Africans  I  had  known  in Moscow.  She  said  that  Bunting  had  died  and  that  Roux was no longer  in  the  Party,  but  still  friendly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  this  I  hear about  the  Party  in  America?” she asked.  I said  that  I  didn’t  know  what  she  meant.  “Well,  it  came  over the radio  last  night that your Party is  dissolving  itself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This ail came as a great surprise and shock to me. It was hard to believe.  I  knew  there  had  been  some  backsliding  and  a  general move to the right.  But dissolve the Party? I wondered if there could have  heen  some  misunderstanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  we  boarded  ship,  we  all met  at  the  USO  by the docks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  the  first  time  since  we had come ashore that  Black and white shipmates had  been ahle to get together.  We made the most of it, drinking beer and swapping stories. Herb Jeffries, a very lightskinned  Black  man with  blondish  hair and blue eyes, was a target of  a  lot  of  kidding.  Herb’s  brother,  Howard,  was  a  nationally-known  singer with  the  Duke  Ellington  band. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p534"></a><img src="index-534_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">512</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we had split up on leaving the dockside bar,  Herb had no choice  but  to  go  with  the  whites.  Now  we  had  some  fun  at  his expense.  “You  goddamn white  son-of-a-bitch,  you  ratted  on  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You left  your  own  race.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You ran out on us at the docks, man. I don’t think we’ll let you back  in  the  race,”  said  Hursel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herb was embarrassed and kind of felt  bad. “What was I gonna do,  man?”  he asked.  “They  wouldn’t  serve  me  with  you  guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hursel winked at me and we kept  putting poor Herb on for some some  time.  What  he  said  was  true,  though.  In  South  Africa,  he couldn’t  pass  for  Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The struggle against the racketeers  had  been going on since we left  San  Pedro,  and  by  the  time  we  left  Capetown  we  had  them pretty well isolated.  We had the goods on  them and they knew it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  had  built  up  a  core  of about twenty-five  guys  who  played  a leading  role  in  the  fight  for  better  conditions  and  against  these crooks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things  were tense though.  One evening I was  on deck,  leaning on the rail, when  Red came up from the engine room. “Harry,” he said, ttbe careful about getting too near that rail at night.. We’re in the  middle  of a  hell  of a  fight  and  those  bastards  would  love to dump you  over!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ship's  committee  met  to  draw  up  charges  against  the racketeers. Two or three of them were direct accusations. Clearly, we said, the racketeers were literally robbing the soldiers with their fixed games. They were obstructing the fight for better conditions on board by setting shipmates against each other. And finally, they were  besmirching the  name  of the  union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we headed up the south Atlantic, we called a general meeting to  present  the charges.  A group  of us got together beforehand to talk  over the issues.  Red  Herrick, the ship chairman, was there as was  Hursel Alexander.  Hursel  was short,  not more than five feet four  inches,  with  broad  shoulders  and  a  hig  roaring voice.  He’d been  one  of the  Party’s  finest  orators.  Red  said,  “After  all these points  are  made  I  want  you  to  sum  it  up,  Hursel.  Really stir the crew up. Then, when you’re through, I’ll call for a vote right away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red chaired the meeting and read the charges. Everybody had a</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">513</p>
<p class="calibre1">say and  most everybody spoke against the racketeers.  As I recall, they weren’t there, but their toadies did their red-baiting for them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  discussion  went  on  for  a  considerable  time.  Finally  Red recognized  Hurscl  and  that  clinched  it.  The  crew confirmed  the charges  and  referred  the  crooks to  a  shores id e committee  of the union  for trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossing  the  Caribbean,  we  were  anticipating  the  time  when, we’d return to San Pedro and get rid of these parasites. This would be  no  problem  since  San  Pedro  was  a  small  port  and  union grievances  could  be  processed  quickly.  We  thought  we  had everything  sewn  up.  Then  one  night,  while  several  of  u$  were standing  on  deck,  one  old  seaman  noticed,  “We’re  not  sailing through any damn  Panama  Canal.  We’re too far north.  Look at those  lights;  there’s  St.  Thomas  and  that’s  Puerto  Rico.  We’re going to New  York,  man!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  word  spread,  the  crooks  started  getting  cocky  again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  knew  the  ropes  in  New  York  and  stood  a  better chance of stalling  things  in  such  a  large  port.  A  few  days  later,  the  ship docked at the military base on Staten Island. Normally, crews were paid off at the end of a voyage with a union patrolman present who was able to  handle grievances.  But the military authorities would not  allow  our  patrolman  aboard  ship.  The  crew  was  paid  off outside the  base  and  everyone who had  been active in our union caucus  was  fired  for  “inefficiency.”  By  the  time  we  could  get through the red tape to raise the issues, the  <i class="calibre4">Uruguay</i> was off shore, on  its  way to  Oran,  Algeria.  The  racketeers  sailed  with  the  ship while we  were  left  in  New  York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  put  up  at  the  Broadway  Central  Hotel  and  stayed there a couple  of weeks.  Nothing  could  be  done  about  our  grievances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the guys went  hack to San Pedro—the shipping administration  gave first  class  fare  back to your home port.  I  decided  to stay  in New  York and take advantage of the union’s program for members  to  upgrade  their  skills  as  cooks  and  bakers.  I  spent  a month  at  Manual  Arts  High  School  on  Thirteenth  Street  near Seventh  Avenue,  learning the rudiments  of baking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  I  was  in New  York  I  went  to  see  Bill  Foster  and  check on  what  I’d  heard  in  South  Africa,  about  the  Party  being</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p536"></a><img src="index-536_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">514</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">dissolved. I went up to the ninth floor of the Party headquarters on East  Thirteenth  Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was Foster, alone in his office, his feet on the desk, his hat pulled  down  to  his  eyes.  He  appeared  to  be  in  deep  thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,  Harry,  I  hear you’re  a  seaman  now,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  told  him  I’d just returned from an around the world voyage, and we talked awhile about the sea. Foster had years before been a sailor  himself.  Finally  I  told  him  what  1  heard  in  South  Africa about  the  Party  being dissolved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”  he  said,  “that  is  what  Browder  has  in  mind.”  When  I asked what  he planned to do about it, he said, “Let’s take a walk, the  walls  have ears...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  we  walked  down  University  Place  toward  Washington Square,  Foster  explained  how  he  saw  Browder’s  line.  “It’s  a rightist  line,” I  recall  him  saying.  “One that just  tails  behind the bourgeoisie.  He thinks  they  will  voluntarily stick to the Teheran agreements.  Browder  is  pushing  the  line  that  the  American capitalists—for their own best interests—will continue the unity of the  big three  [the  U.S.,  USSR  and  Great  Britain—cd.] after the war is  over.  He  wants us to continue the no-strike pledge, and  is saying  that  there  won’t  he any  more  economic crises  or  wars  or class  conflicts—only peace and  prosperity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster told me how Browder was then proposing to change the Party into an “association,” for this was in line with his view that the two-party system is adequate. What it all came down to is that he not  only wanted to dissolve the  Party—he wanted to liquidate Marxism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again  I asked  Foster what he was planning to do.  I remember that  his  greatest  concern was  to  avoid  a  split  in the  Party  in the middle of a war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” I asked, “isn’t Browder going to dissolve the Party in the middle of the war? There certainly is an opposition, why not lead i t r</p>
<p class="calibre1">He hedged, saying Browder was looking for the chance to expel him.  By this time, we had returned to the Party headquarters. We agreed to keep in touch. What I did not know then was that Foster had  written  a  letter to  the  National  Committee  opposing  Brow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p537"></a><img src="index-537_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">515</p>
<p class="calibre1">der’s  line.  This  letter  was  read  at  the  Political  Committee  a  few days  before  our  conversation  on  February  8,  1944,  and  was opposed by every other committee member except Sam Darcy of Pennsylvania.  Further,  it  had  been  made  clear  at  the  time  that Foster  would  be  expelled  if  he  attempted  to  take  the  struggle against  Browder to  the  rank  and  file. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  a  difficult time for me.  I knew from discussions with others, especially seamen, that there was fairly widespread opposition to  Browder’s position.  But no one was sure what to do. The opposition  existed,  but  it  had  no  leadership.  Browder  was systematically  violating  democratic  centralism  by  stifling  any thorough  discussion  of his  new  policies.  Thus  the  opposition in various parts  of the country remained  isolated from each other.  I found  myself  feeling  very  much  like  many  others.  Browder’s business was really bad, but it was being steamrollered through. At the time, it seemed the only thing that could  be done was to bide our time,  waiting for  events  to  expose  Browder’s  opportunism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">LI EE ABOARD THE  ERICSSON</p>
<p class="calibre1">Late in March  1944,1 signed  on as assistant baker on the  <i class="calibre4">John</i> <i class="calibre4">Ericsson</i>,  for the first  of four voyages  on that  ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the period of preparation for the long-awaited second front in the  European war.  This  had been deliberately delayed by Britain  and  the  U.S.  since  1917.  The  dominant  theme  in  the relations  between imperialist countries and  the Soviet  Union had been  the  former’s  desire  to  crush  the world’s  first socialist state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  earliest  manifestation  of  this  had  been  their  pouring  over 900,000  troops  into  the  Soviet  Union in the early twenties to aid the  white  armies  in  the  civil  war.  When  the  Red  Army  proved indomitable,  their  policy took  the form  of economic  embargos and diplomatic boycotts. During the period of the Third Reich, the British,  French  and  American  governments  saw their chance to move  against  the  Soviets  through  a  third  party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, when Nazi Germany rose to become a major power, the imperialist powers followed a policy of appeasement and financial</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p538"></a><img src="index-538_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">support,  hoping  to  induce  the  Germans  to  turn  eastward.  The U.S., Britain and France refused to take action against Germany's illegal  remilitarization,  its  reoccupation  of  the  Rhineland,  its support  of the  fascist  invasions  of  Ethiopia  and  China,  and  its direct  intervention  in  Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The day after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, this policy was articulated  by then  Senator  Harry Truman  who  said,  “If we  see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning,  we  ought  to  help  Germany.”7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when circumstances forced Britain, France and the United States  to  ally  themselves  with the  Soviet  Union  against  the  axis powers,  this  policy continued.  The most striking example of this was their refusal to open up the second front in Europe until three years after the  Nazi invasion of Russia. The Soviets thus bore the main brunt  of the anti-fascist fight, and the number killed, perhaps 18,000,000,  was  twenty-seven  times  the  total  U.S.  and  English deaths  combined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  time  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">second </p>
<p class="calibre1">front  was  finally  opened,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red  Army  had  already  broken  the  back  of Hitler’s  Wehrmacht at  Moscow,  Leningrad  and  Stalingrad,  and  had  crossed  into Poland  on  its  way  to  Berlin.  The  decision  to  land  troops at Normandy was prompted as much by the British and American imperialists’  desire  to  prevent  a  Soviet  sweep  to  the  Atlantic as  by  their  desire  to  shorten  the  war.  It  is,  in  fact,  estimated that their delay in opening the second front prolonged the war by a full  year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The   <i class="calibre4">Ericsson</i>  was formerly a Swedish luxury liner,  now leased to  the  U.S.  as  a  tro o p   ship.  She  usually  carried  about  5,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">troops  on  her  trips  from  New  York  to  Liverpool.  We  would go  in  a  big  convoy  with  a  number  of  other  troop  ships  and  a number of escort  vessels.  The allies hy that time were building up for the opening of the second front and the invasion of Normandy, which  was  to  take  place  in June  of that year.  It took us about a month to make the round trip. We’d drop the troops in Liverpool and  then  sail  up  to  Scotland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  four  or  five bakers and  assistants in the  <i class="calibre4">Ericsson’s</i> baking department.  The chief baker was a Swede named Vidal. He</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">517</p>
<p class="calibre1">had heen chief baker on the  <i class="calibre4">Ericsson</i> when it was a luxury liner. He was  a  fine  pastry  chef  and  we  baked  bread  for  the  whole  ship, pastry  for the  officers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vidal outdid  himself, making chocolate eclairs, bismarcks and Danish pastry.  I loved the work and by the time I got off that ship, I could  make all  kinds of pastries. Vidal was a good teacher, but he was  a  little sore that all the young guys were learning so fast.  He was from the old school and had been apprenticed to a baker at the age  of twelve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  used  to tell us how the chief baker would  stride in  with his head  up  in  the  air  and  all  the  boys  would  greet  him,  “Good morning,  Herr Chief Baker” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  had  to wash pans for a year before they’d even let  me torch the dough,” he would tell us, “and now you guys come on here and expect  to  be  bakers  in a  few  months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  also met Jake “the  bread  baker” Rabinowitz on the  <i class="calibre4">Ericsson. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  a  specialist  in  sour  dough  bread.  He’d  come  up  the gangplank  with  a  little satchel  and  all  the  old  bakers would say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here  comes Jake  with that same old  mother dough  he’s had for twenty-five years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  we  dropped  the  troops  off  we  had  a  chance  to  see Liverpool. It was an old port city which had suffered heavily from Hitler’s  blitz  and  large  sections  of the city lay in ruins.  The pubs were fascinating places. They were real social centers where people spent the evening drinking beer and playing darts. The British were polite and someone would  always come up to my table and strike up a conversation. Perhaps because l was Black, they would often raise  criticisms  of  Americans  which  they  didn’t  mention  to  my white  shipmates.  They  couldn’t  stand  the  way  some  Americans were always boasting and carrying on about American superiority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  British  were  proud  too,  but  in  a quiet  way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong with  the Yanks?” I’d ask when the subject came up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re over paid,  over sexed  and over here,” came the reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  German  counter-offensive  at  the  Battle  of the  Bulge was going  on  and  the  British  followed  it  carefully.  “The  Yanks  are getting  it  now,”  they’d  say.  “Americans  were  so  critical  of our</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighting,  but  they’re  finding  out  it’s  no  easy  road.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  we’d  leave Liverpool, we’d go up to Glasgow,  Scotland, and  pick up German prisoners and wounded.  It was easier to take them back to the U.S. than to ship food over for them. As our ship pulled  out  of  Gourock,  Glasgow’s  port,  the  German  prisoners would  be  assembled  on  the  deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d ask, “Are there any bakers here?” Inevitably some would step  forward  because  they  knew  they’d  get  better  food  if they worked  in the  kitchen.  So on the return voyages we ship’s bakers could  take  it  easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were a lot of good fellows in  our crew,  but we were slow getting the ship organized. After my first voyage I got in touch with A1  Lannon,  the  Party’s  waterfront  organizer  and  member  of the Central Committee.  I asked about the possibility of getting one or two good Party men aboard to help us make the  <i class="calibre4">Ericsson</i> a model union ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s  in  port  here?”  I  asked  Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll  tell you just  the  guy you  need.  It’s  Harry  Rubin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  not  sure  I  know  him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  a  man  with  tremendous  drive  and  a  hell  of  a  dynamie organizer,” Al said.  “You  put  him on that ship and  he’ll  be a real help.  But  1  should  warn you, he has a kind  of puritanical streak. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rubin was a little fellow who walked with a  limp as a result of being wounded in Spain.  He signed on as wiper in the engine room, the lowest job there.  Sure enough, he helped whip the whole thing together  in  short  order.  In  no  time  at  all  we  had  the  whole  ship tightly  organized.  The  committees  and  delegates  in  all  the departments were functioning well. The crew was up to standard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  presented  and  won  many grievances  and  improved  the food and  living  eonditions.  There  were classes  for  the  crew  on union history  and  improving technical skills.  As educational director, I taught  a course  on  the  nature  of fascism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  couple  of voyages later, there was an incident which  proved Lannon’s cautions about Rubin to be correet.  Rubin charged two</p>

<p class="calibre1">Puerto Rican crew members with selling a couple pints of liquor to two of the soldiers on board. The union had a strict policy on this sort of racketeering,  but the attitude of most of the crew was, “We don't  want  to  press  this too  hard.  It’s just  a  small case.  Just  tell them  they  can’t  do  it  anymore.”  There  were  no  big  racketeers aboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Rubin took a hard line. He insisted that charges be brought against  them  and  that  they  stand  trial  before  the  union  port committee  in  New  York.  There  was  a  division  on  the  ship’s committee and many of us thought we should be a little flexible in this  situation,  but  in  the  end  we  followed  Rubin’s  lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The incident made for hard feeling among the crew and divided the  ship  which  we  had  worked  so  hard  to  organize.  The  union meeting on board which we called to diseuss the charges was very heated.  The defendants  claimed  the  charges  were  an  example  of discrimination  against  Puerto  Ricans.  There  were  about  fifty Puerto Ricans in the crew and  about  the same number of Blaeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The defendants were able to line most of them up on their side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In truth, Puerto Ricans and Blacks had some real grievances. They were mostly in the steward’s department and many lived way down in  the  glory  hole,  the  worst  section  of  the  ship.  Also,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“evidence” against the defendants was flimsy and consisted of two affidavits signed by two soldiers long gone from the ship. The crew was  split  down  the  middle,  and  when  the  vote  was  called  as  to whether the defendants should  be charged  and  stand trial in New York,  about  sixty  percent  voted  no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  later  voyages,  we  were  able  to  unite  the  crew  under  our leadership again.  Rubin, however, didn’t sign on again because he, more than any of us, had isolated himself from the rest of the crew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I quit the  <i class="calibre4">Ericsson</i> in early September,  1944.1 planned to return to  Los  Angeles,  but  I  had  followed  the Soviet  counter-offensive with  intense  interest.  The  victories  at  Stalingrad  and  Leningrad and  in  the  Crimea  had  pushed  the  Germans  back  beyond  the border. Thus, I was determined to make the Murmansk run before I  returned  to  the west  coast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I went down to the union  hall on West Seventeenth Street. No one  told  where  a  ship  was  bound  during  the  war,  but  when  the</p>

I  packed  my  bag,  being  sure  to  include  my  Russian grammar book and dictionary, and a Russian edition of Tolstoy’s <i class="calibre4">War  and  Peace</i>  so  that  I  could  bone  up  on  my  once  fluent knowledge of Russian, 1 then hurried to New Jersey and signed on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  sailed  on  September  26,  1944,  for  Halifax,  Nova  Scotia, where the convoy assembled.  We had a heavy escort of destroyers, cruisers, and corvettes as we headed for Glasgow, Scotland. After docking  at  Gourock  on  the  Clyde,  we  headed  north  along  the Scottish coast to  Lock Ewe, where we reassembled for the last leg of the Murmansk run. A British commodore took over command of  the  convoy,  calling  a  conference  of  captains  to  explain  the procedures  and  route  for  making the dangerous run through the Norwegian  Sea,  around  the  North  Cape  to  the  Kola  Inlet  and Murmansk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving Lock Ewe, we were a formidable convoy of about thirty ships  in  all.  Our  escort  vessels  included,  frigates,  destroyers, corvettes and “baby” air craft carriers (escort carriers). The cargo ships  were  also  armed.  Our  liberty  ship  had,  in  addition  to the normal crew of forty-four men, a navy gun crew of eighteen which manned  the  two  three-inch  fifty  caliber-type  cannons,  several twenty-millimeter Oerlikon  anti-aircraft  guns  and  lighter caliber machine guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The convoy,  we  understood,  was also given distant cover by a British battleship  and cruiser of the home fleet, which lay just out of  sight.  Further  protection  was  afforded  by  the winter  solstice which  provided  virtually twenty-four hours  of darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crew’s quarters were midship, the portholes looking out on the aft deck cargo. There were several narrow gauge train engines lashed to the deck.  Heading northeast, we entered the Norwegian Sea,  one  of  the  world’s  stormiest  seas.  It  didn’t  take  much imagination  to  visualize  the engines  breaking loose  and  crashing through our bunks.  It certainly  didn’t make for a relaxed voyage, </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">521</p>
<p class="calibre1">but  then  neither did the  Germans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  sub  packs  hounded  us  throughout  the  voyage.  Our reminder  of their  presence  was  the  constant  dropping  of depth charges  which  shook  everything  and  everyone  on  ship  as  the bulkheads quivered and the deck plates rattled. But we were lucky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was later revealed that no less than eighteen U-boats were lying in  ambush  for  our  convoy.  When  we  arrived  in  Murmansk,  we learned  that  only  one  escort  frigate  had  been  damaged  by  a torpedo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our convoy was routed unusually close to the Norwegian coast, probably  not  more  than seventy-five miles  offshore. The  normal route  took  convoys  far  from  German  occupied  Norway.  It  was understood  that  we  were  attempting  to  lure  the  battleship   <i class="calibre4">Von</i> <i class="calibre4">Tirpitz</i>  out  of  the  fjords.  A  year  before,  her  sister  ship,  the <i class="calibre4">Scharnhorst</i> had slipped out to attack a similar convoy and, after a long chase, was sunk by the British Navy. But this time the   <i class="calibre4">Von</i> <i class="calibre4">Tirpitz</i>  did  not  accept  the  challenge  and  remained  in the fjord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Off  North  Cape  we  were  attacked  by  a  formation  of sixteen German torpedo bombers. General alarm was sounded. I rushed to my  position  as  assistant  loader  on  the  Oerlikon  gun,  life jacket slung  around  my  neck  and  rubber  suit  under  my  arm.  The engagement  lasted only a few minutes.  Heavy fire from our entire convoy  quickly  brought  down  three  planes and  drove the others off.  They  did  manage  to  drop  a  few  torpedoes,  but  they  went astray,  doing  no  damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We finally dropped anchor in the Kola Inlet in early November. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half  our  convoy,  including  our  ship,  unloaded  our  cargo  in Murmansk.  The remaining ships sailed across the White Sea and on  to  Archangel.  Our  first  sight  of  Murmansk  was  the  badly battered  dock  and  railroad  spurs.  It  was  a  prime  target  for the Luftwaffe,  which  had  a  base  in  Petsamo,  Finland,  barely  sixty miles  from  Murmansk.  By the time  I  got  there,  the  Soviets  had installed so many heavy anti-aircraft guns and had brought down so  many  planes  that  the  bombing  was  greatly  reduced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  last  we  were ashore  in  Murmansk.  Formerly the  Russians had given a SI25  bonus to each seaman for making the run. This was  a  gesture  of  appreciation  and  provided  money  to  spend  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p544"></a><img src="index-544_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">522</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">port.  But at  the behest of the  U.S. government, they had stopped this  practice.  We drew  money  from the captain to spend ashore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last ashore, the  Russian language sounded beautiful to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the voyage over I  had spent several hours a day boning up on my Russian. Once ashore, I became fluent again and found myself translating for  my  shipmates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  no  doubt  Murmansk  was  a  front  line  town.  There were only two places to go for relaxation and diversion. There was the International  Seamen’s Club and the International Hotel.  At the  club  tbere  were  often  American  movies  and  dances  on  a Saturday  night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crews from the convoy crowded into the Seamen’s Club and were  soon  drinking  the  good  old  Russian  vodka.  But  we  soon discovered that vodka, unlike whisky, was not a liquor to be drunk neat  as  was  the  American  custom.  Under  the  influence  of  the vodka  the  meekest  fellows  soon  became  roaring  lions.  Several fights broke out. The Russians looked on with amazement at this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  the  matter  with  you  Americans? ”  they  asked  after finding that I  could speak Russian. “Can’t you take your liquor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah well, they’re just blowing off steam after the terrible tension of tbe voyage,”  I  answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thereafter, the Russians restricted the Americans to one drink of  vodka  in  the  club,  which  was  equivalent  to  a  double  in  our measure.  On  our  part,  a  few  of us  union  guys got  together and constituted  ourselves  as  an  ad  hoc  committee to  maintain  order ashore.  We served notice that henceforth any seaman who caused trouble and was giving the crew a bad name would have his shore leave  taken  away for tbe duration  of our  stay in  port. We posted notices  to  that  effect  on  the  bulletin  board  of  the  club.  The Russians  were very pleased  with  our  self-disciplinary  action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My Russian came right back and I spent a lot of time in the clubs and met a whole number of Russians. They took me around to the factories  and  Russian  clubs.  Among  my  friends  was  the  ship chandler  who  took me  out to bis home  and introduced me to  his family.  I was sitting in his office one day when two white American seamen  came  in.  They  asked  the  chandler  if  he  could  sell  them some  vodka.  He  told  them  that  he  wasn’t  permitted  to  sell  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  MERCHANT  MARINES</p>
<p class="calibre1">523</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals,  that they would have to get a permit from the captain of the ship. The chandler could understand a lot of English but he couldn’t  speak  the  language,  so  I  volunteered  to  translate.  My proffered  help was  met  by  a  hostile  stare  by  these two drunks.  I heard their drawl and  knew where they were from. One, the most belligerent,  glared  at  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s talkin’  to you?  Keep  out  of this,”  he growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  I  know  Russian  and  thought  I  could  help  you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  don’t  need  your  help.  We’re  from Texas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  good,”  I  rejoined,  “some  of  my  hest  friends  are  from Texas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stood up and put my hand on the water bottle on the chandler’s desk.  They  turned  and walked  out  of the  place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  chandler was taking it  all in,  apprehensive that something was going to happen. “Comrade,” he said, “Pm so glad you didn’t allow  yourself to  be  provoked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He told me that a year ago, a Black seaman had been killed right there  in  Murmansk  by  white  seamen.  “Do  Black  people  always have to fear for their lives in the United States?” he asked, puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  one can expect attack at anytime, but  not all whites are hostile.  And  Blacks  have their  own communities.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He seemed puzzled by the whole thing. “I guess it’s  like the Jews under the  old  regime,”  he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely,”  I  agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  went  over  to  the  International  Hotel  and  joined  some of my  white  shipmates  sitting  around  a table.  1  told  them about what  had  happened  at  the  chandler’s.  Just  then  the two  fellows came  in  and  sat  down  at  the  next  table.  One  of  my  mates,  a reconstructed Southerner—Texas Red we called him—got up and started talking loudly about “god damn rednecks.” The two slunk out  of the  bar  and  that  was the  end  of it.  We  figured  they  were members of tbe SIU,  a Jim  Crow  seamen’s union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  night  I  came  into  the  International  Hotel  and  after checking my boots and coat, I saw a group of young Russians, men and  women,  standing  in  the  lobby.  It  was  on  the  eve  of  the anniversary  of  the  Russian  Revolution.  They  saw  me  speaking Russian  to the attendant, so one young Russian approached  me. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He was a small fellow, dressed in the Georgian manner with long coat,  hat  and  soft  Caucasian  boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  think  I  know you,”  he  said.  “Weren’t you  in  Moscow some years  back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  I  was,”  I  answered,  surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you  remember my sisters Vera and  Era?”  Vera and Era were two  young  women  in  our circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh  yes,”  I  said,  “how  are  they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  was just  a  small  boy  when  you would  come  around.  Vera married  Patterson, the American  Black  man who came over with the  film  troupe.  He  died  in  the  evacuation  from  Moscow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  I’m  sorry,”  I  said.  “ How  is  she  doing  now?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,” he said. “She has a nice apartment and her two sons are coming  along  well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was just about to ask about Ina,  who had also been a part of that same circle, when he broke off, explaining that he had to go to a performance  as  he  was  a  member  of a  dance troupe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meet  me  back  here tomorrow  night,”  he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  came back to the hotel the next night, but he wasn’t there. He probably had another performance. I didn’t know his name or how to  ask  for  him.  Sadly,  I  never saw  him  again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  too long after we arrived in  Murmansk,  we received  word that  the   <i class="calibre4">Von  Tirpitz</i>  had  been  sunk  (November  12,  1944)  in  a successful attack by twenty-eight  Lancaster bombers of the Royal Air Force. This was certainly welcome news for it meant the end of the major German naval threat to convoys on the Murmansk run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were relieved to know our return trip would not be threatened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  human  enemy was  more  or less taken care of,  but the old enemy,  the  sea  itself,  was  there  to  be  reckoned  with.  The Norwegian Sea was a brutal sea, particularly rough at that time of year.  Terrible gales buffeted the convoy and dispersed it over the whole area. Separated from the rest of the ships, we were forced to run alone.  The decks, fore and aft, were awash continuously. We struggled  into  Loch  Ewe  one  by  one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  return voyage  was  fairly  uneventful.  But even that  late in the  war,  German  submarines  were  still  a  very  real  threat.  I remember  we  were  almost  home,  just  off  Buzzards  Bay  in</p>

<p class="calibre1">Massachusetts.  There was  a submarine scare,  and depth charges shook the whole ship violently.  One of our  mates, a fireman, was clown in his quarters counting up his hours. He came up frustrated as hell, “Everytime I started counting, a depth charge would go off and  I’d  have to start  all  over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was seventeen below when we docked in Portland, Maine, on January  11,  1945.  That night we took the train to New York City. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Russians  had  given  every  seaman  at  Murmansk  a  gallon  of good  vodka.  On the way down to New York we broke them open and shared them with the passengers. The first thing we did when we got off the train  was go to the Cafe Society downtown and see Billie  Holiday,  the  Black  singer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a week or ten days in New York, I took the train home to l.os  Angeles.  I  was  happy  to  return  to Belle and  we had a warm reunion,  exchanging stories,  discussing  the  war and the political developments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  wasn’t  long  before  I  became  anxious  to  get  back  to  sea.  In March I signed  on a motorship  we called the   <i class="calibre4">Turk's Knot</i>.  It was smaller than the liberty ship, but brand new, just out of the yards. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">t</i>  We  sailed  in  early  March  for  the  Pacific  war  zone.  It  was understood  that  our  destination  would  be  the  Philippines,  with stops  in  Honolulu,  Wake,  the Truk  Islands and Guam.  Our ship would  then  shuttle  between  New  Guinea  and  Manila  carrying installations  and  other  war  materiel  the  Americans  had  been forced to leave  behind  as they moved northward island by island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  first  stop  in  the  Philippines  was  the  port  city  of  Cebu, located  on  an  island  of the  same  name, right  in the center of the Philippine  Archipelago.  Cebu  was  next to the island of Mactun. </p>

<p class="calibre1">virtual  graveyard  of ships.  They  were  undoubtedly  an  overspill from the crucial  battle for the Gulf of Leyte, which took place on the  eastern  side  of the  islands  in  October  1944.  It  was  here  that Admiral Nimitz’s fleet had put the finish on the Japanese Navy and MacArthur’s  troops  returned  as  he  had  vowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wreckage was so great we had to anchor a mile or two out in the  harbor and  go  into  town  on  water taxis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Manila,  a  friend  and  1  ran  into  a  group  of revolutionary students  and  intellectuals  who  had  ties  with  the  Hukbalahap guerillas,  or  “Huks.”  They  had  been  active  in  the  anti-Japanese resistance  movement  and  bitter  struggles  against  the  traitorous compradors and landlords who had aided them. They told us how, after  the  Huks  and  the  underground  had  helped  to  recapture Manila,  they had been  disarmed  hy American  troops.  They  were bitter  and  sharply  critical  of  MacArthur’s  hostility  toward  the popular  democratic  movement.  His clear intention  was  to return to  the  status  quo  of  colonialism.  They  gave  us  lots  of  their literature and during the following months  of our shuttle we saw them  whenever  we  were  in  Manila. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  Manila  we  would  sail  southward  to  New  Guinea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stopping  at  the  small  port  towns  of  Hollandia,  Wewak  and Oro  Bay, all on the north coast of New Guinea,  we would  gather our  cargo  of  war  materiel  and  return  to  Manila.  The  round trip of some thirty-six hundred miles would take about fourteen to twenty  days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HOMECOMING  AT  WAR4S  END</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  April  we  received  news  that  Roosevelt  had  died.  The  news saddened  the  crew,  everyone  seemed  to  realize  that  Roosevelt’s death  marked  the end  of an  era. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Early in the summer a letter from Belle reached me in Holland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  fears  were  realized—the  Communist  Party  had  been dissolved  and  the  Communist  Political  Association  (CPA)  had been  founded  in  April  1944.  Belle  informed  me  of the  recently published  Duel os  letter  and  the  removal  of  Earl  Browder  from</p>

<p class="calibre1">leadership.  Duclos,  then  secretary  of  the  French  Communist Party,  sent  a letter to the National  Board  of the CPA which was received  on  May  20.  In  this  letter  he  characterized  Browder’s Teheran  thesis  and  the  subsequent  dissolution  of  the  Party as  a  “notorious  revision  of  Marxism.”8  The  publication  of the letter opened a floodgate of criticism with regards to Browder’s position.  It came at  a time when events were rapidly proving that his  theories  of  “class  peace”  and  national  unity  under  the leadership of the monopolists were grossly incorrect and did not in any  way  correspond  to  reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Duclos  letter  opened the way for struggle in  opposition to Browder.  The  groundswell  of  opposition  reached  the  national leadership  and  led  to  the  Emergency Convention  of July  26-28, 1945, where the errors of the past were exposed and the Party was reconstituted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  very  excited  by  this  letter and  anxious to  return  to  the States.  I was not disappointed, therefore, when we learned that our ship  had  developed  engine  trouble  and  our scheduled  twelve  to eighteen  month voyage  would  be cut short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  had  scarcely  left  New Guinea on  the trip home when  news came over the ship’s  radio  that an atom  bomb had been dropped on  Hiroshima.  It was August 6,  1945. Three days later we learned that  a  second  and  more  powerful  bomb  had  heen  dropped  at Nagasaki.  We  knew  then  that  it  would  not  be  long  before  the Japanese  surrendered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What we didn’t know and what has generally been overlooked is that the day after Hiroshima the Russians invaded Manchuria in a powerful  two-pronged  offensive.  The  devastation  wreaked  by the  atom  bombs  was  indescribable,  but  its  details  were not fully known,  either  in  Japan  or  the  United  States,  until  months afterward.  But  everyone  in  Japan  was  aware  of  the  Russian invasion and it was probably this threat of war on t wo fronts which was a considerable factor in forcing Japan to accept the reality of its defeat.9</p>

<p class="calibre1">month  before.  For the  First  time  I  was  able to  study  the  Duclos letter,  as well as  the documents from the convention.  Included in these was the letter written by Foster, opposing Browder’s Teheran thesis.  Foster  had  submitted  the  letter  on  Jan.  20,  1944,  to  the National Committee where it was rejected overwhelmingly.  It was not  until  the  emergency  convention  that  this  letter  was  made public  and  anyone  outside  of the  National  Committee  knew  of Foster’s  opposition to  Browder.10</p>
<p class="calibre1">We  spent a week or so relaxing and discussing what we should be doing now. We decided to go back to New York. I went first to find an apartment. Belle packed up our belongings in Los Angeles and  closed  the apartment. </p>
