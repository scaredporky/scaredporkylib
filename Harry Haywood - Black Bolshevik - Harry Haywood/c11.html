<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">My  Last  Year</b> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">in  the  Soviet  Union</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  Lovestone’s  expulsion  from  the  Party  in  June  of 1929,  Nasanov  and  I  continued  our  work  in  the  Negro  Commission of the Comintern. We both loved the work which involved a tontinuous check on the press  of the  U.S. Party (then the   <i class="calibre4">Daily</i> <i class="calibre4">Worker</i> and   <i class="calibre4">The  Communist</i>); the minutes and resolutions of the Party’s  leading  committees;  and  other  labor  and  progressive publications  in  which  Party  members  were  active. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  included   <i class="calibre4">Labor  Unity, </i> the organ of the TUUL, and   <i class="calibre4">Labor</i> <i class="calibre4">Defender</i> which was put out  by the International Labor Defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  material  was  to  be  found  in  the  Comintern  Information Department  whose  American  representative  at  the  time,  as  I remember,  was  A.  G.  Bosse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I acquainted myself with the material, 1  became pleased and excited at the advances the Party had made in work among Blacks, The U.S.,  it seemed, had entered  the third  period  with a bang—a rapid decline of the economy and growth of mass unemployment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  impressive  was  the  widespread  resistance  of  workers  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">“rationalization’’ (wage cutting, stretch-out and speed-up), and the anti-union  terror  campaign  of employers  backed  by  the  federal, state  and  local  governments.  The  resistance  was  reflected  in the needle trades,  mining,  automobile and  textile  industries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All this was  two months before the October 1929 stock market crash  and  the  onset of the economic crisis which was to embrace the  whole  capitalist  world.  The  Party,  now  freed  from  faction</p>

<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST YEAR  IN  THE  SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">317</p>
<p class="calibre1">alism, had united on the basis of the Comintern Address and was vigorously  moving  forth  to  organize  and  lead  the  mounting struggles of the workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasanov  and  I  felt  the  hest  evaluation  of  the  Party’s  work among Blacks was put forward by Cyril Briggs in a series of articles which  appeared  in  the June,  July  and  September  1929  issues  of <i class="calibre4">The  Communist.1</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs  characterized  the  Sixth  Congress  of tbe  Cl  as  a  major turning  point  for  the  Party  in  carrying  out  a  revolutionary program in Afro-American work.  Using the struggle against white chauvinism as a barometer of the effectiveness of the Party’s work in this area, he pointed out that “prior to the Sixth Congress, white chauvinism  in the American Party (in both factions!), unmasked at that Congress by Comrade Ford, and mercilessly condemned by that  supreme  revolutionary  body,  made  progress  in  Negro work well-nigh  impossible.”2</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the Sixth Congress there were only a handful of Blacks in the  Party,  but  since  then  the  Central  Committee  had  set  up  a National Negro Department  to help in the formulation of policies and  in the direction  of the work  nationally.  District  and  section Negro committees were formed in most areas of Party concentration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the Sixth Party Convention, Black comrades were elected to the highest  body in the Party,  the Central  Committee, and to the National Executive Committee of the Young Communist League. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  also  elected  to  the  Party’s  Politburo,  the  National Bureau  of  the  League,  and  added  to  district  committees  and section  committees.  Another  step  forward  was  registered  at  the founding convention of the TUUL in September  1929; of the 800 </p>
<p class="calibre1">plus  delegates,  68  were  Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, this was only a beginning. White chauvinism was still  pervasive and  represented a powerful influence in the Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs  then  turned  a  critical  spotlight  on  the  most  dramatic struggle  of the  period—the  strike  of Southern  textile workers  at Gastonia, North Carolina, which took place in the spring of 1929. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  strike—led  by the  Party  and  the  National  Textile  Workers Union,  an  affiliate  of  the  TUEL—was  the  Party’s  first  mass</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a><img src="index-326_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">318</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">activity in the South. It was therefore a test for the new line on the unions  and  on  the  Afro-American  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Southern  textile  industry—and  Gastonia's  mills  were  no exception—was  traditionally  a  white  industry with  Blacks  about five  percent  of the work force. The whites were new proletarians from the mountains and farms, employed by northern mill owners who  had  moved  their  mills  south  to  exploit  the  cheap  and unorganized  labor  of  the  region.  In  Gastonia,  these  workers responded  to  their  exploitation  by  striking  against  “stretch-out” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  starvation  conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bosses  used  the old  battlecry of white supremacy to divide the Black and white workers and try to break the strike.  It created an atmosphere of reeking race hatreds and suspicion, and this was the  state  of  things  when  the  National  Textile  Workers  Union launched  its  organizing campaign  in  Gastonia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*The mill owners and their local myrmidons—the sheriff, police, militia,  foremen,  managers  and  extra-legal  arms  of the  KKK— </p>
<p class="calibre1">sought  to  maintain the status quo threatened by the strikers.  The strike speedily took on a political character, reaching the point of armed  conflict. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The heroic woman strike leader, Ella May Wiggins, was pursued and shot down in broad daylight. The Gastonia chief of police was kilted  and  several  deputies  wounded  when  they  attacked  a  tent colony  which  strikers  had  formed  after  being evicted  from  their company-owned  homes.  Sixteen  strike  leaders,  including  some communists,  stood  trial  for  the murder  of the  police chief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  reign  of  terror  that  ensued  made  the situation  extremely difficult for our organizers. Clearly there could be no retreat from the principle of organizing Blacks and whites into one union on the basis  of complete  equality,  yet  there  were some union and  Party leaders  who  wanted  to  back  down  in  the  face  of  the  prevailing chauvinism  among the white  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Central Committee firmly laid down the line against such a retreat.  Following the line of the  ECCI resolution, it insisted that the  new  union  embrace  all  nationalities  and  colors  and  that separate  unions  for  Blacks  were  to  be  organized  only  in  those trades  from  which they  were barred by the reactionary policies of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a><img src="index-327_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST YEAR  IN  THE  SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">319</p>
<p class="calibre1">white union leaders.  After their initial wavering, the local  leadership  rallied  to  the correct line.  Blacks and whites were organized into  the  same  union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Testimony to  this  is  a  dramatic  incident involving my brother Otto.  I hadn’t heard much of Otto since he’d returned to the States, only that he’d  been placed  on the Central Committee at the Sixth Convention  and  was  working  in  the  Negro  Department  of  the TUUL.  As TUUL organizer, he had been sent to Gastonia. He was at  nearby  Bessemer City at  the time of the attack  on the strikers’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">tent colony and the shooting of the police chief. Otto was unaware of  what  had  happened  and  that  the  stage  had  been  set  for  his lynching should  he  return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  an  article in  the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> described  the  incident: Otto  Hall..was on  his way...to Gastonia on the night of the raid...the white workers, realizing the grave danger to which Hall  was  exposed  if he happened  to  get  into Gastonia  that night,  formed  a  body  guard  and  went  to  meet  Hall  and warned  him  to keep away.  They met  Hall  two  miles  out  of town  and  took  him  in  a  motorcar to Charlotte where they collected enough money among themselves to pay his railroad fare to New York. No sooner had Hall embarked on the train a mob broke into the house where he hid before his departure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was only timely action  on the part of these white workers that saved  the life of their  Negro comrade.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gastonia struggle signaled a new period in the Party’s trade union  work—a  period  which  characterized  the  thirties  overall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  the  leadership  of the  Communist  Party and  our left trade unions,  Black  and  white  workers  were  organized  into  the  same unions on the basis of equality and in the common fight against the capitalists.  The  Party  was  able  to  mobilize  mass  support for the strike  and  the  sixteen  leaders  framed  for  murder,  in  cities throughout the South and the country as a whole. Otto personally spoke  in  some  twenty-seven  cities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  what  was  to  be said about the needle trades union,  long a bastion of the left? Briggs pointed out the “criminal” apathy of the comrades  working  in  this  area.  The  Needle  Trades  Industrial Workers’  Union  only organized  Blacks in times of strike, and as a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a><img src="index-328_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">320</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">result,  had  very few Black members.  While the union had special departments and scores of functionaries for Greek, Italian, Jewish and  other  immigrant  workers,  there  was  no  Afro-American department  and  not  a  single  Black  functionary.  This,  at  a  time when in New York alone there were several thousand Black needle trades  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Comrades in the Miners Union made a similar underestimation of  work  among  Afro-Americans.  This  union,  operated  in  an industry  which  had  a  large  number  of  Black  miners—in  some fields  even  out-numbering  the  white  workers—but  had  not  yet appointed  a  single  Black organizer.  In Illinois  District  Eight (my old  district),  there  occurred  a  particularly  blatant  case  of white chauvinism. William  Kruse, the district organizer, refused to share the  pool  of funds  available  for wages  with  Comrade  Isabel,  the Black  functionary.  He  persisted  in  this  practice  despite  the demands  of  the  National  Secretariat  that  the  funds  be  shared equitably.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the numerous examples of white chauvinism, there was no doubt that the Party was making advances in regards to Negro work.  In  fact,  it  was  precisely  because  of  these  advances  that chauvinistic  practices  which  hitherto had gone under wraps were brought  out  into  the  open  and  attacked.  Briggs*  series  of three articles  was  the  sharpest  attack  on  white  chauvinism  ever  published  by the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their publication reflected that despite the many shortcomings in our work, there was a growing awareness in the Party leadership of  the  seriousness  of  the  question.  The  rapid  deterioration  of economic  conditions  affecting  both  Black  and  white  workers allowed  no complacency.  If the  Party was going to play a leading role in tbe coming struggles, it would have to carry on a continuous struggle  against  white  chauvinist  ideology and  practices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was heartened by Briggs’s articles. At the same time, however, I was  somewhat  disturbed.  While  Briggs  evoked  the  Comintern resolution  on  the  Negro  question  in  his  blast  against  white chauvinism,  he  was  curiously  silent  on  the  theory and  program underlying the resolution. It was certainly true, as Briggs said, that among revolutionary  white workers,  white chauvinism was often</p>

<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST  YEAR  IN  THE SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">321</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifested in the “general underestimation of the role of the Negro masses  in  the  revolutionary  struggle.”  But  to  say  no  more  than that  was  to  avoid  the  essence  of the question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What were the ideas and theories fueling this underestimation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly they were to  be found  in the remnants of Lovestone’s line which  still  clung  to  the  Party—the  hangovers  of  the  social democratic  view  which  considered  the  fight  against  the  special oppression  of  Blacks  to  be  a  diversion  from  the  class  struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  line  was  a  drastic  break  with  the  social  chauvinist doctrines of the past, and  in  it the Party had  a  mighty weapon in the  fight  against  white  chauvinism  and  petty  hourgeois  nationalism  of the  Garvey  stripe.  But  the new  line could  not simply be declared,  it  had  to  be fought for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As months passed, Nasanov and I searched in vain through the Party  press  and  documents  for  further  discussion  of  the  1928 </p>
<p class="calibre1">resolution.  The  resolution  of  the  October  1929  plenum  of  the Central  Committee  had  noted  the  increasingly  important  role the  Black  proletariat  played  in  building  the  new  unions.  Its Program  of  Action  called  for  “merciless  struggle  against  white chauvinism  and  any  attempt  towards  segregating  the  Negro workers.” 5 Following the plenum, the National Agitprop Department had  promised to publish a special discussion bulletin on the Afro-American  question.  None  ever materialized,  however. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the beginning of 1930, it was becoming clear to us that there was not only confusion in the Party, but definite opposition to the new  line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to confirm our misgivings, the February  1930 issue of   <i class="calibre4">The</i> <i class="calibre4">Communist</i>  contained  an  article  by  veteran  Black  communist Otto  Huiswood, titled “World Aspects of the Negro Question.” It was the first article in a year to broach the theoretical aspects of the question, but it was a direct challenge to the line of the Comintern Sixth  Congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Huiswood sought to establish a difference in character between the oppression of Blacks  in Africa and the West Indies, and those in  the  USA.  The  question  in  Africa  and  the  West  Indies,  he contended, was a national question, but in the United States, it was a race question. According to Huiswood, the Black minority in the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a><img src="index-330_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">322</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">U. S,  lacked the requisites of a nation.  It had “no distinct language and  culture  from  the  dominant  racial  group...its  only  distinguishing  feature is its  racial  origin.”6</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus,  Huiswood pulled the Afro-American question out of the category  of national-colonial  questions and dumped it  back  into the muddy waters of “race question.” He had fallen back upon Sik and his “social race” theory, which asserted the primacy of the race factor,  race  ideologies,  in  the  oppression  of U.S.  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By making race primary, Huiswood’s article denied the validity of self-determination as a slogan for Black liberation. It rejected the concept  of  Blacks  in  the  South  as  an  oppressed  nation,  and therefore  rejected  the  perspective  which  called  for  the development of a national revolutionary movement based on the masses of Black  soil-tillers  and  workers  in  that  region. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Huiswood’s  article  demanded  an  answer,  Nasanov  and  I  felt that  it  could  in  the end serve a  positive purpose in  that  our reply afforded an excellent opportunity to clarify a number of areas of misunderstanding  and  confusion.  Our  response  could  be  the vehicle to finally settle accounts with Sik and demolish his “social race”  theory.  Nasanov  had already written a polemic against  Sik exposing  the  latter’s  incredible  ignorance  of Lenin’s  position  on the national question. This was to be published in the April issue of <i class="calibre4">The  CommunistJ</i>  I  would  take  on  Huiswood  directly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First  I  answered  his  assertion  that  Blacks  in  the  U.S.  had  no special culture. “Negroes have a culture which reflects their whole historical  development  as  a  people  in  the  U.S.,”  I  pointed  out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  as to  separate language... this is  not  one of the prerequisites of  the  nation.”8  I  referred  to  Stalin,  who  said:  “A  common language for every nation,  but not necessarily different languages for different  nations.”9</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  was there in fact a difference in the character of oppression between Blacks in the U.S,, on the one hand, and in Africa and the West  Indies  on  the  other?  I  concluded  that  there  was  no  such difference.  It  was  clear  to  me,  of course,  that  Blacks  in  the U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">were not a colony in the formal sense of the term. Unlike a colony, they  were  not  separated  geographically  from  the  metropolitan country. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a><img src="index-331_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST YEAR  IN THE SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">323</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was, however, no substantive difference in the character of Black oppression in  the United States and  the colonies and semicolonics.  In  both  instances,  imperialist  policy  was  directed  towards  forcibly  arresting  the  free  economic  and  cultural  development  of  the  people,  towards  keeping  them  backward  as  an essential  condition  for  super-exploitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  attempting  to  prove  a  difference  in  the  character  of  oppression,  Huiswood  wound  up downgrading the anti-imperialist content  of  the  Black  liberation  struggle  in  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  the  Sixth  Congress  I  had  given  considerable thought to the  race  factor  and  its  role  in  the  question  of  U.S.  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly it was clear that race played an  important role in the Afro-American  question,  but  it  was  only  one  element  and  not the central  question  itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  course,  I  pointed  out:  “It  would  be  a  serious  mistake  to underestimate the  profound  social  role  played  by these theories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arising  first  as  a  moral  sanction  for  a  national  colonial  policy, these dogmas  become fixed  in  laws,  in turn  influence politics and in  this  manner  react  again  upon  the  social and  economic  basis, sharpening and deepening the exploitation of subject peoples and perpetuating  the existing  social  relations.”10</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  reality,  1  wrote,  the  racial  persecution  of  Blacks  was  a particular  form  and  device  of  national  oppression.  The  racial element was a peculiarity of the question of U.S. Blacks. Nowhere, with the exception of apartheid in Southern  Africa, had race been made to play such a decisive role. Nowhere had it served for such a long  period  as  an  instrument  of  ruling  class  oppression.  The prominence  of racial  ideologies  in  Black  oppression  in  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">arose  from  the  necessity  of  the  white  rulers  to  maintain  the degradation  of  Blacks  in  the  midst  of  the  most  modern  and advanced  capitalist  society  in  the  world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under these conditions the bourgeois rulers had to pursue “the most  energetic  policy  in  order  to  keep  up the bar  of separation between white  and Negroes, i.e., retard the process of assimilation and  thus  preserve the conditions for the super-exploitation of the latter.”11</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  absence  of  pronounced  cultural  distinctions  such  as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a><img src="index-332_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">324</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">language or religion, I argued, the “racial visibility* of U.S. Blacks was  used  by  bourgeois  social  theorists  as  the  most  convenient factor upon which to erect spurious theories of white supremacy, in order to set them apart from the masses of the white population as  permanent  objects  of scorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sik,  (and thus  Huiswood) on the other hand, counterposed the race question to the national question.  They asserted that  Blacks were separated from the dominant white race solely by “artificial racial  divisions  and  race  oppression  arising  on  this  basis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sik  compounded  these  errors  when  he  reduced  the  whole national  question  to  a  struggle  between  competing bourgeoisies for  markets:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among American Negroes there is no developing industrial bourgeoisie,  hindered  in  its  economic  development  the struggle of which (for its free economic development) for the winning of internal markets and for the removal of obstacles </p>
<p class="calibre1">' standing in the path of economic progress,  could give these national movements a progressive character.12</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the national question, as Stalin pointed out, had undergone changes from that earlier period  when it first appeared as part of tbe  bourgeois  revolution.  Now,  in  the  period  of socialist  revolution,  it  was  part  of the  struggle  of the  proletariat: It  is  quite  evident  that  the  main  point  here  is  not  that  the bourgeoisie  of one  nationality  is  beating,  or  may  beat,  the bourgeoisie of another nationality in the competitive struggle, but  that  the  imperialist  group  of the  ruling  nationality  is exploiting and oppressing the  bulk  of the masses,  above all the  peasant  masses,  of the  colonies  and  dependent  nationalities  and  that,  by  oppressing  and  exploiting  them,  it  is drawing them into thestrugglc against imperialism, converting them  into allies of the proletarian  revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  in sharp  contrast  to  the  formulation put forward  by Sik  and  espoused  by  Huiswood.  Sik,  I  contended,  made  tbe ideological  factor  of  “racism”  more  important  than  the  social question  itself.  Thus,  in asserting the primacy  of racial factors in the  question,  Sik  and  Huiswood  reduced  the  Black  liberation struggle  to  a  struggle  against  racial  ideology.  They  saw only  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST YEAR  IN THE SOVIET UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">325</p>
<p class="calibre1">bourgeois assimiJationist trend, “a striving towards intermingling and  amalgamation,  towards  full  social  equality”  in  the  struggle and not the potential national  revolutionary trend of the masses.14</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Black liberation struggle was reduced to a feeble  bourgeois liberal protest against racism and racist ideology, divorced from its economic  roots,  and  to  be  resolved  through  education  and humanitarian  uplift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling that  it would  add some clarity to the situation, I ended my piece with the serious economic and historical analysis of the question that Sik and Huiswood bad so assiduously avoided.  As I saw it,  the  evolution  of American Blacks as an oppressed  nation was  the  result of the unfinished  bourgeois  democratic revolution of the  Civil  War  and  Reconstruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  advent  of  imperialism  froze  the  Blacks  in  their  post-Reconstruction  position—landless,  semi-slaves  in  the  South.  It permanently blocked  the road to fusion of Blacks and whites into one  nation  on the basis of equality under capitalism. The struggle for  genuine  equality  was  thenceforth  ultimately  bound  in  the South to take a national revolutionary and socialist revolutionary direction.  This position defined the status of Blacks inthe north as an  unassimilablc  national  minority,  as  the  shadow  of  the  plantation  fell  upon them  throughout  the  country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think Huiswood was won over by my argument; at least I saw nothing more  in the Party  press trumpeting Sik’s “race” theories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In looking hack on the thing now, I think it was a sort of skirmish in  the  war  to  carry  out  a  revolutionary  program  on  the  Black national  question.  As  long  as  the  Party  leadership  vacillated  in carrying  out  the  line  of  the  Sixth  Congress,  such  old  and reactionary  theories  were  bound  to  persist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I must say, however, that things were not standing still at home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  progress  in  the  struggle  was  slow,  it  was  progress  nevertheless. Amid a great upsurge in the workers* movement, the Party was beginning to implement the line of the Sixth Congress, though there  was  still  some vacillation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  biggest  thrill that spring had  been the nationwide demonstrations  of the  unemployed  led  by  the  Party  and  tbe  TUUL  on March 6,  1930. Over one and a quarter million workers responded</p>

<p class="calibre1">to the Party’s call in over a dozen cities coast to coast.  H undreds of workers  and  Party  leaders  were  arrested.  William  Z.  Foster, Robert  Minor,  Israel Amter and Harry Raymond were sentenced to three years in jail for leading a demonstration of 110,000 in New York’s  Union  Square,*5  They  served  at  least  a  year  of  these sentences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Party also led large and militant May Day demonstrations in  several  cities.  Ail  this  clearly  indicated  that  the  Party  was becoming a  leader  of the  masses,  as more and  more people were thrown  into  struggle  by  the  deepening  economic  crisis  and  the capitalist  offensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Party  chalked  up an astounding success in  its recruitment drive.  In a  period  of two or three months the Party recruited into its  ranks  over 6,000  new  members,  90% from  basic industry and 1,000  of whom were Blacks.16 A considerable numher of the latter had  come  from  the  disintegrating  Garvey  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of this upsurge the Seventh Convention of the U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party convened in New York on June 22,1930, and Nasanov and I followed  the  proceedings  closely.  The  Party’s  estimate  of  the economic crisis  and  perspectives  for the future were discussed  in detail,  emphasizing  the  need  to  defeat  the  right deviation  in  the Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  summarized  hy  Browder,  then  General  Secretary,  the convention  ohserved  "that  the  economic  crisis  shows  the stabilization  of capitalism  approaching its end, that  it brings close the realization  of  war,  and  that  it  will  in  many  countries  be  transformed  into  a  political  crisis,  and  that  the  working class will  be more  and  more  unable  to  find  any  path  except  that  of  revolutionary struggle.” At the same time, the convention recognized the need  to  struggle  against  the  "leftist”  concept  of the  crisis  as  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"automatic  hearer of revolution.” 17</p>
<p class="calibre1">Internally  the  Party  was  in  a  qualitatively  different  position than it had been at the time of the Sixth Convention in 1929. It had broken  away  from  the  crippling  factionalism  that  had  all  but paralyzed its work.  It was now consolidating its forces on the basis of  the  decisions  of  the  Cl  and  had  seized  the  initiative  in  the growing  revolutionary  trend  in  the  country. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There were a score of Black delegates (17%) present and for the first  time  the  Afro-American  question  was  characterized  as   <i class="calibre4">"the</i> problem  for  our  Party.”1*  While  it  was  evident  that  important advances  had  been  made in the work, the convention brought  out that “this could  not  be credited to the clarity of understanding of the  Party  as  a  whole,”19  and  that  a  “proper  orientation  is lacking.”20</p>
<p class="calibre1">Much  discussion  and  debate  did  not  clear  up  this  confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder, for instance, denigrated the slogan of self-determination by  making  the  Black  rebellion  contingent  upon  a  revolutionary situation in the whole country. “The transformation of this slogan into  one  of  action  is  conditioned  upon  the  maturing  of  a revolutionary situation for American capitalist society.”21 Overall, however,  we  felt the convention  represented  progress in terms  of work  among  U.S.  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My three-year term at the Lenin School  was drawing toward a close in June  1930.1 began thinkingabout homeand what awaited me on my return. I had little organizational experience in the Party before  coming  to  the  Soviet  Union,  and  now  began  to  wonder what  type  of work  I  would  be  doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  I  was  to find  that  Nasanov had other immediate plans for me.  He  felt  that  I  should stay for a few months  longer and work with the CL  It was felt (I presumed  by Kuusinen and  others) that the Comintern should intervene once more on the Black question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly  the  brief  resolution  adopted  at  the  Sixth  Congress  two years  previous was not sufficient.  Now a more detailed statement of  the  question  was  needed.  They  had  in  mind  another  Cl Commission  on  the  question  that  would  meet after the  Seventh Convention of the U.S.  P a rty -o n e  set up to discuss and work out such a  statement  when  all  the  proceedings from that convention were  available,  The  convention  would  undoubtedly  point  up remaining  areas  of confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘‘Wouldn't  it  be  best  for  you  to stay,  Harry?”  asked  Nasanov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eventually everything  will  work  out,”  he said,  “but  it would  be better for you to return  with a new Cl resolution, That way you’ll be off to a good start. If you left now, you might get battered about in  the  fights  there.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  RILIJ’S  FIFTH  CONGRESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Fifth  Congress  of the Red International  of Labor Unions (RILU)  was  to  convene  in  Moscow  August  15,  1930.  Delegates started  arriving  several  weeks  early.  The  U.S.  delegation,  thirty strong,  included  seven  Blacks—the largest  number ever to attend an  RILU  Congress.  They  had  come  to  Moscow  via  Hamburg where  they  had  participated  together  with  Africans  and  West Indian  blacks  in  the  founding  conference  of  the  International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers, initiated by the RILU. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Hamburg  delegation  was  led  by James  Ford,  head  of the Negro Department of the Trade Uni on Unity League, a member of the  executive  committee of the RILU,  and provisional chairman and  chief organizer  of the  Hamburg Conference-  His  co-worker and  assistant  was  George  Padmore,  also  a  TUUL  national organizer.22</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  U.S.  delegation  included:  Harold  Williams,  KUTVA graduate and a member of the railroad workers union in Chicago; Helen  McClain,  a  Philadelphia  needle  trades  worker;  Ike  Hawkins,  a  Pennsylvania  coal  miner;  and  Arthur  Murphy,  a  Pennsylvania  steelworker.  Of  the  delegation  I  only  knew  Ford  and Padmore,  and  I  hastened  to  make  the  acquaintance of the other delegates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were a young, enthusiastic group, fresh from struggles in their respective industries in which they had played leading roles. I was  especially  impressed  by  the  young  Black  woman  from Philadelphia,  Helen  McClain.  She  was  a  natural  leader,  lively, attractive,  humorous  and  the center  of attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The delegates  filled me in on news from home and related what had  happened  at  the  Hamburg  Conference.  The  conference  had been in preparation for nearly a year. A provisional committee had been  set  up  under  the  chairmanship  of  Jimmy  Ford.  It  was originally  scheduled  to  be  held  in  London,  metropolis  of  the world’s  greatest  colonial  power.  But  it  appeared  that  the  conference  organizers  had  reckoned  without  their  hosts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  preparations  came  under  the  scrutiny  of  His  Majesty’s</p>

<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST  YEAR  IN  THE  SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">329</p>
<p class="calibre1">Labor  Government,  headed  by  Ramsay  MacDonald,  whose Colonial  Secretary was the well known  Fabian  Socialist,  Sydney Webb.  They  would  not  allow the  conference  to  meet  in  London and  at  the  last  minute,  delegates  and  organizers  moved  it  to Hamburg,  Germany.  After some delay it opened  on July 7,  1929. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were seventeen regular delegates and three fraternal (nonvoting)  delegates representing 20,000 workers  in  seven countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides  the  U.S,  delegates,  there  were  delegates  from  Jamaica, Nigeria,  Gambia,  the  Gold  Coast  (now  Ghana),  the  former German  colonies  of the Cameroons (now  Cameroon) and  South Africa.  The South African delegate was a white trade unionist, an active fighter for black-white unity in the trade union movement, who  was  acting  as  a  proxy  for a  black  trade  unionist  whom  the apartheid  government  had  denied  a  passport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  conference lasted three days.  There was  an  interchange of experiences;  reports  by  Ford,  Padmore and  Patterson (the last a fraternal delegate from the Anti-Imperialist League). A number of resolutions were adopted and a permanent organization formed— </p>
<p class="calibre1">the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers.  An executive  board  was  elected,  including Ford,  Hawkins,  McClain and  Padmore  from the U.S.;  Kouyate from  French West  Africa; Frank MacCaulay from Nigeria; Albert Nzula from South Africa; G.  Small  of Gambia;  and  G.  Reid  of  Jamaica.  Representatives from  Haiti,  Liberia  and  East  Africa  were  to  be added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A monthly publication,  <i class="calibre4">The Negro Worker, </i> was established with Padmore as the editor.  Headquarters of the organization were set up  in  Hamburg.  Many black sailors came into that international port—the  second  largest  in  Europe—and  the  organization’s literature  later  was  circulated  there  by  these  sailors  throughout Africa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  International  Trade  Union  Committee of Negro  Workers was  the  first  attempt  to  bring together black workers  on a world scale.  Though  the  founding  conference  was  small,  it  was  historically important, because it  was the first time Black workers from Africa and the Americas had  gotten together.  It was a wedge into black  Africa  wbich  hitherto, with  the exception  of South  Africa, had  been  isolated  from  the  world  revolutionary  movement. </p>

<p class="calibre1">330</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">The main effort of the organization was to promote trade union organization  in  Africa  and  the West Indies, linking them up with the world revolutionary trade union movement  led by the RILU. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  workers  in  the  U.S,  were  to  play  a  vanguard  role  in  this endeavor  because  of  their  greater  political  and  organizational experience,  the  result  of their position as an oppressed  people in the  heartland  of the  most  advanced  capitalist  country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Fifth  Congress  of  the  RILU  met  in  the   <i class="calibre4">Dom  Soyuzov</i> (House  of  the  Unions)—meeting  place  for  most  of  the  international  congresses  held  in  Moscow.  I  attended  a  number  of sessions  of  the  congress,  along  with  delegates  from  Fifty-five countries.  As  this  was  also  the  Tenth  Anniversary  of the  RILU, business  sessions  were  accompanied  by  a  number  of festivities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  Soviet  hosts  seemed  determined  to  make  it  a  memorable occasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of the  things  I  remember best about the congress was the presence of a dozen or so veterans  of the  1871  Paris Commune— </p>
<p class="calibre1">now old  men  in  their seventies  and eighties.  As  I  remember, they wore  uniforms—red  caps,  red-lined  blue  capes  and  short  white canvas  leggings.  At  the  opening celebration,  one  of the  men  on seeing  us  rushed  up  to  embrace  me,  welcoming  us  as  “my brothers,” fighting “for the  world  commune.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  congress  opened,  the  Moscow  press  published  an article  by  RILU  leader  A.  Lozovsky.  He  listed  the  main  tasks of the  congress:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Closer to the masses by means of the united front from below, combat Right opportunism and ‘left’ sectarianism, the actual leadership  of the economic mass struggle  of the proletariat, aid  for the weakest  sections of the  world  proletariat, closer contact  of the  colonial  slaves  with  the  working class  of the capitalist countries and the proletariat of the Soviet Union.23</p>
<p class="calibre1">The RILU had come to this approach through years of struggle which  Lozovsky  had  summarized  in  an  article  published  two weeks  before the congress.24 When the RILU was formed in  1920, the  main errors  came from “left” anarcho-syndicalist tendencies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in  later years, especially after the Ninth  Plenum  of the ECC1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  Fourth  RILU  Congress  in  1928,  the  main  danger  came</p>

<p class="calibre1">from the right.  By  1930,  open right opposition to the decisions of these meetings had  been defeated and remaining right tendencies, though  still  very  dangerous,  were  under attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lozovsky  warned,  however,  that  in  the  course  of  the  fight against  right  opportunist  tendencies  and  for  the  line  of  “class against  class” and independent  leadership of economic struggles, left-sectarian  tendencies had cropped  up,  involving the danger of alienation  from  the  masses.  This  left  tendency  was  one  which lumped  together  the  social-fascist  (reformist)  leaders  and  the workers  who  followed  them.  Not  knowing  how  to  work  in reformist trade unions for the realization of the “united front from below,” they shouted “leftist” slogans such as “permanent general strike,”  and  “armed  strikes,”  all  of which  remained  mere words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,  Lozovsky  pointed  to  the  RILlTs  weaknesses: The  most  important  of these  faults  are:  lagging behind  the mass, and  the disproportion between political influence and organizational consolidation of this influence...In spite of all this,  the  RILU  has  accomplished  a  great  work  in  uniting, rallying and  ideologically  welding together the forces of the international revolutionary movement.25</p>
<p class="calibre1">The congress only lasted about ten days; I attended a number of sessions  and  had  the  chance  to  hear  Lozovsky,  Padmore  and James  Ford,  who  reported  on  the  Hamburg  Conference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  conference  broke  down  into  working  commissions;  each national delegation met to discuss their respective problems. After the  congress  adjourned,  the  delegates were taken on tours  of the Soviet  Union,  the  Dniepcrstroy  Dam,  the  Stalingrad  plants  and other sights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  1930 RESOLUTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Negro  Commission  of  the  Cl  convened  in  late  August, under  the  chairmanship  of  Otto  Kuusinen.  Members  of  the commission  included:  Earl  Browder,  James  Ford,  Bill  Dunne, William  Weinstone,  William  Patterson,  Mingulian  (head  of the Anglo-American  Secretariat),  Mikhailov  (Cl  rep  to  the  U  S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">332</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Party), Nasanov, myself and several Black students from the Lenin School  and  KUTVA.2*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuusinen was well versed in the problems of the U.S. Party and its  work among Blacks.  Prior to the commission, and in preparation for it, he had talked on numerous occasions with Nasanov and myself as well as with leading U.S.  comrades present in Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  also  received  a  report  from  Mikhailov who had recently returned  from  a visit  to the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  immediately  got  down  to  the  business  at  hand.  As  I remember, he commended the U.S.  Party on its recent progress in Afro-American  work  and  its  struggle  against  white  chauvinism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  reflected  in  the fact  that  the  Party  in  the  last  year  had recruited  over  1,000  Blacks  into  its  ranks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  he observed, despite this advance, the pre-convention discussion preceding the Seventh Convention of the Party and the convention  itself revealed  that there was still  much confusion on the question. This fact had heen admitted by the leading American comrades  themselves.  Looking  over  the  materials  from  the discussion  on  the  question,  it  was  quite  clear,  he  noted,  that the Party  had  not  yet  overcome all underestimation of the  slogan of the  right  of  self-determination.  There  were  still  large  areas  of unclarity  on  the  question  generally, Kuusinen  then  proceeded  to  pinpoint  these  areas  as:  a  false counterposing of the slogan  of “social equality” and “the right of self-determination”  and  the  lack  of understanding  of their interrelationship.  The  U,S.  convention  had  raised,  but  not  answered, the following questions:  Should the right of self-determination be considered  only a slogan of propaganda or one of action? Should separatist  tendencies  among  Blacks  be  supported  or  opposed? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should the area of Black concentration in the South be regarded as a  colony  or  as  an  integral  part  of  the  national  economy  of the United States? Could a revolutionary uprising occur in the South independent  of the  revolutionary  movement  in  the  country  as  a whole? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuusinen  suggested  the  discussion  center  on  these  areas  of unclarity  without excluding any other questions comrades  might want  to  raise.  After  the  discussion,  a  new  resolution  should  be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a><img src="index-341_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST YEAR  IN THE  SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">333</p>
<p class="calibre1">drafted addressing itself to these questions. I noticed the bitterness and  acrimony that had characterized earlier meetings were absent from  the  discussions  that  followed.  Freed  from  factional  considerations,  it  was  evident  that  everyone  was  honestly  seeking clarity  on  the question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a few days of discussion,  Kuusinen  himself undertook to draft a  resolution.  Further discussion  followed,  but  on the whole there was agreement.  After a few minor changes it was adopted by the  commission  and  eventually  became  the  resolution  of  the American  Party  on  the  Black  national  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resolution  proceeded  straight  to  the  heart  of the  controversial  issues.  It  reasserted  the  position  of  the  Sixth  Congress which  defined  U.S.  Blacks  as  an  oppressed  nation.  Implicitly,  it rejected  the  position  of  Sik  and  others  with  their  one-sided emphasis  on  race  as  the  primary  factor  in  Black  oppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stressing instead  the  basic social and economic factors, it defined it as “a question of an oppressed nation which is in a peculiar and extraordinarily  distressing  situation  of national  oppression,  not only  in  view  of  the  problem  of  racial  distinctions  (marked differences  in  the  color  of skin,  etc.),  but  above  all,  because  of considerable  <i class="calibre4">social antagonisms</i>  (remnants  of slavery).” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resolution  struck  out  at  the  tendency to  counterpose the slogans  of “social  equality”  and  the “right of self-determination” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  dealt  in  detail  with  their  interrelationship.  In  this  respect, it pointed out the necessity of making a clear distinction between the north and the South in the application of these slogans—hetween the oppressed Black nation in the South and the national minority in  the  north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equality,  the  resolution  contended, could only be  obtained by the.continuous  fight  for abolition  “of all forms of economic and political  oppression  of  the  Negroes,  as  well  as  their  social exclusion, the  insults perpetrated against  them  and their segregation.  This is to be obtained by constant struggle by the white and Black  workers  for  effective  legal  protection  for  Blacks  in  all fields,  as  well  as  actual  enforcement  of  their  equality  and combating  of every  expression  of Negrophobia.  One of the First Communist  slogans  is:  Death  for Negro  lynching!”27</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a><img src="index-342_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">334</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  demand  for  equality,  the  resolution  said,  “applies  to  all Negroes,  in  the  North  as  well  as  in  the  South.”  In  the  north  it embraced  all,  or  almost  all,  the  special  needs  of the  masses  of Blacks.  This,  however,  was not so in  respect to  the South,  where the situation of Blacks was that of an oppressed nation. Here, the resolution  held, “the  main Communist slogan must  be:   <i class="calibre4">The right</i> <i class="calibre4">o f self-determination  o f  the  Negroes  in  the  Black  Belt.”2*</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  South,  the  attainment  of  full  equality  involved  the question  of political  power  needed  for  its  enforcement  and  this could  be construed in no other manner than political power in the hands of the Black masses of peasants and workers of that region. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  in turn could only be achieved through the fulfillment of the main  slogan  of the  right  of self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This did not  mean that the slogan of equality was not applicable to  the  South  where  Blacks  suffered  “the  glaring  lack  of  all equality.”  But  here  it  applied  to  the  most  urgent  partial  or immediate  demands  of  the  Black  masses.  The  two  slogans  were thus  closely  connected;  the  winning of self-determination  in  the South  was  the  prerequisite  for  full  equality  in  the  north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anticipating  the  possibility  of  autonomous  demands  in  the north,  the  resolution  added:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The struggle for  the equal  rights of the Negroes does not in any  way  exclude  recognition  and  support  for the  Negroes* </p>
<p class="calibre1">rights to their own special schools, government organs, etc,, wherever  the  Negro  masses  put  forward  such  national demands of their own  accord.29</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resolution  emphasized  that  the  question  was  a  “national question  in the U.S., not only in the South but also in the North.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It went on to say that “The struggle for equal rights for the Negroes is  in fact  one of the most important  parts of the proletarian  class struggle  in  the  United  States.’* White  workers  must: march   <i class="calibre4">at  the  head</i> on  this  struggle.  They  must  everywhere make a breach in the walls of segregation and “ Jim-Crowism” </p>
<p class="calibre1">which have been set up by bourgeois slave-market morality... </p>
<p class="calibre1">white  workers  must  boldly  jump  at  the  throat  of  the  100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">per cent bandits who strike a Negro in the face. This struggle will  be  the  test  of  the  real  international  solidarity  of  the American white  workers.30</p>

<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST YEAR  IN THE  SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">335</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resolution  rejected  the  characterization  of the  Black  Belt (the  area  of Black  concentration  in  the South) as a colony.  Such characterization, it contended, could only be based on “artificially construed analogies, and  would  create superfluous difficulties for the  clarification  of  ideas.”  However,  it  warned,  “It  would  be nonetheless false to try to make a fundamental distinction between the character of national oppression to which the colonial peoples are subjected  and  the yoke  of other  oppressed  nations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The resolution asserted that the Black Belt “is not in itself, either economically or politically, such a united whole as to  warrant  its being  called  a  special  colony  of  the  United  States,”  Nor  on the other hand, was it “such an integral part of the whole United States as  any  other  part  of the  country ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For one thing, industrialization of the Black Belt, in contrast to most  colonies,  was  not  in  conflict with the interests  of the ruling U.S.  imperialists,  Therefore,  expansion  of industry  in the  Black Belt  would  “in  no  way  bring  a  solution  to  the  question of living conditions  of  the  oppressed  Negro  majority,  or  to  the  agrarian question,  which  lies  at  the  basis  of  the  national  question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrialization  in  the  area  would  only  sharpen  the  contradictions  in  that  it would  bring forth “the most  important driving force  of the  national  revolution,  the  hlack  working-class.”11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The resolution lists three fundamental slogans of the liberation movement  in  the South'.  1)  The right of self-determination—this slogan,  however,  can  be  carried  out  only in connection with two other basic slogans. 2) Revolutionary land reform. (Theresolution pointed out that “landed property in the hands of white American exploiters  is  the  most  important  basis  of  the  entire  system  of national oppression.”) The agrarian revolution must be completed by the confiscation of the landed property of white landlords and capitalists  in  favor  of  the  masses  of  Black  farmers.  3)  The establishment  of the state unity of the  Black  Belt.  The resolution called for the political and geographic unity of the Black Belt, that is,  the  bringing  together  of Black  majority areas  in  one  governmental administrative unit. This would include a significant white minority.  The  resolution  assails  the  idea  of a  nation-state exclusively inhabited by Blacks or the transportation of Blacks to Africa. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Any  such  attempt  "to  isolate  and  transport  the  Negroes,”  the resolution  warned,  "would  have the  most  damaging effect  upon their interests.  Above all,  it  would  violate the right of the Negro farmers in the Black  Belt not only to their present residences and their land,  but also to the land owned  by the white landlords and cultivated  by  Negro  labor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The right  of self-determination means, according to the resolution, the unlimited right of Blacks in the region to exercise, if they so  choose,  governmental,  legislative  and  judicial  authority  over the entire territory and to decide upon the relations between their territory  and  other  nations,  including  the  United  States,  This would mean the overthrow of the class rule of the U .S. imperialists upon  whose  power the  local  landlords  and  capitalists depended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  right  of  self-determination,  therefore,  included  the  full freedom  of  separation  for  the  Black  nation.  The  resolution contended  that "if it  desires  to  separate  it  must be free to do so; but if it prefers to remain federated with the United States, it must also  be  free  to  do  that.”32  This,  the  resolution  stated,  was  the correct  meaning of self-determination.  This right  must be fought for  as  a  "free  democratic  right”  whether  the  U.S.  was  still  a capitalist  state  or  whether  the  proletarian  state  had  been  established. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  right  of  self-determination  must  not  be  construed  as identical with  secession.  The  resolution  quoted  Lenin: We demand freedom of separation, real right to self-determination certainly not in order to recommend "separation,” but on  the  contrary,  in  order  to  facilitate  and  accelerate  the democratic  rapprochement and  unification  of nations.33</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resolution  noted  that  separatist  trends  in  the  Black movement should not be supported "indiscriminately and without criticism.”  There  were  reactionary  separatist  trends  as  well  as national  revolutionary  trends.  An  example  of the  former, it  was pointed  out,  was Garvey’s  African  utopia  of an  isolated  nationstate consisting  of Blacks  alone.  Politically,  this  was  a diversion from  the  struggle against  U.S.  imperialism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  if the situation  does not yet  warrant the raising of the question of uprising, one should not limit oneself at present to propaganda  for  the  demand:  ‘Right  to  self-determination/ </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  should  organize  mass actions such  as  demonstrations, strikes,  tax-boycott-movemcntx,  etc.34</p>
<p class="calibre1">The resolution enjoined communists to stand in the forefront of the fight  for national liberation  and  to  fight  for the hegemony  of the  Black  proletariat  in  the  national  struggle.  It  outlined  the Party’s tasks in building revolutionary organizations in the South, organizing  proletarian and peasant self-defense against  the KKK </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  like  reactionaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Final success in this struggle was possible only if supported  by mass  actions  of  Black  and  white  proletarians  throughout  the country.  “Only  a  victorious  proletarian  revolution  will  <i class="calibre4">finally</i> decide  the  agrarian  question  and  the  national  question  in  the South  of the  United  States, in the  interests of the predominating mass  of the Negro  population  in  the  country.”35</p>
<p class="calibre1">It spoke directly against those who held that the Black rebellion was contingent upon the maturingof the revolutionary situation in the  country  as  a  whole  or that  it could only develop at the same pace as the overall class struggle. This assumption, widespread in the  Party  at  the  time,  reflected  an  underestimation  of  the inherently  explosive  character  of  the  liberation  struggle  in  the South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lenin  defined  national  rebellion  as  mass resistance to oppression.  “Every act  of national  oppression  calls forth resistance,” he wrote.  And  further that  “the tendency  of every  act  of resistance on  the  part  of the  oppressed  peoples  is  the  national  uprising.”36</p>
<p class="calibre1">The entire thrust of the resolution  was to prepare the Party for any  contingency:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether the rebellion of the Negroes is to be the outcome of a general revolutionary situation in the United States, whether it is to originate in the whirlpool of decisive fights for power by the working-class, for proletarian dictatorship, or whether on  the contrary,  the Negro  rebellion  will  be the  prelude of gigantic  struggles  for  power  by  the  American  proletariat cannot  be  foretold  now.  But  in  cither  contingency,  it  is</p>

<p class="calibre1">essential  for  the  Communist  Party   <i class="calibre4">to  make  an  energetic</i> <i class="calibre4">beginning already  now</i>  with the  organization  of  <i class="calibre4">joint mass</i> <i class="calibre4">struggles</i> of white and  black workers against Negro oppression. This alone will enable us to get rid of the bourgeois white chauvinism which is polluting the ranks of the white workers of America,  to  overcome the distrust of the Negro masses... </p>
<p class="calibre1">and to win over to our side these millions of Negroes as active fellow fighters in the struggle for the overthrow of bourgeois power throughout America.57</p>
<p class="calibre1">INA</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  time  for my  departure  was approaching.  I  thought of Ina and  the  future  of our  marriage.  She had  been  much in my mind these  last days in Moscow  as  I reflected  back on  our three happy ye^rs  together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  my  busy schedule  at  the school,  we  managed to spend most  weekends  together  at  her  mother’s  apartment  on  Malaya Bronaya,  a  short  distance  from  the  school.  It  was  Ina  who  had introduced me to the cultural life of the Soviet capital. Together we attended theaters, movies, concerts at the Conservatory of Music, and Moscow ballets and operas at  the  Bolshoi Theater.  We often visited  the  Park of Culture  and  Rest, a wooded area across from the  Kremlin  along  the  Moscow  River.  It  combined  restaurants, theaters and amusements.  Exhibitions  of all sorts were held there as  well.  Other  times  we  went  boating  on  the  Moscow  River. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ina  had  given  up  her  ballet school studies a year or so before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was now attending the Institute of Foreign Languages where she  was  studying  English.  She  displayed  a  great  aptitude  for languages  and  her  English  was  quite  good.  After only  a  year  of study she  had  begun  to  read  American literature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though  not a  member of the  Communist Party, she was what they called a “non-Party social activist”; that is, sympathetic to the Party  and  actively  supporting  its  aims  of building socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the time for my departure drew near, we earnestly discussed the  future  of  our  marriage.  We  had  agreed  that  it  should  not be  terminated  with  my  departure.  Our  idea  was  that  we  would</p>

<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST  YEAR  IN  THE SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">339</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventually  get  Ina  to  the  States.  Of  course,  I  anticipated  some difficulties, but to my mind they were not insurmountable. For one thing,  we  were--by  mutual  choice-unencumbered  by  children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ina was a  friendly,  outgoing  person  and  I  felt she  would  have little  trouble  adjusting  to  a  new  environment  and  would  be accepted by the Black community in any of the big urban centers of the  north.  1  would  undoubtedly  be  assigned  to  national  Afro-American  work  at  the  center  in  New  York  City  on  my  return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  all, even  professional  revolutionaries  were not homeless itinerants  of  the  old  Wobbly  tradition.  Many  were  married  and had  families,  even  in  situations  where  both  were  full-time  professional  revolutionaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So as we saw it, our separation was to be temporary. We agreed that  once  settled  in  my  future  work,  perhaps  in  a  year  or  so, I would  either  send  for  Ina  or  return  myself  to  bring  her  back to  the  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  before  my  departure, an  incident occurred  which  forcibly brought home to me the contrast between the socialist world which I  was  leaving and the racist  world  which I was about to re-enter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  incident  occurred  in  Stalingrad,  one  of  the  new  huge manufacturing  cities  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  location  was Tractorstroi, a basic unit of the Five Year Plan with a capacity of 50,000  tractors a year.  The plant stretched fifteen miles along the Volga River. They had brought over about three hundred and fifty highly  skilled  white  mechanics  from  the  United  States,  who— </p>
<p class="calibre1">together  with  their  families—formed  a  small  American  colony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  had  their  own  restaurants  supplied  with  the  best  food, tobacco  and  wines  that the  Soviets  could  furnish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Into  this  situation  stepped  a  lone  Black  toolmaker,  Robert Robinson.  A  native  of Jamaica  and  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen, Robinson  was a graduate of Cass Technical  High School  in  Detroit,  He had come to Moscow under a one-year contract to instruct young  Soviet  workers  in  the  Stalingrad  plant  in  the art  of toolgrinding.  He  had  formerly  been  employed  by  the  Ford  Motor Company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the morning of his arrival in Stalingrad he was shown into the  American  dining  room.  He  sat down  at a table for breakfast</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">before starting work where he was immediately insulted, beaten up and  thrown  out  of the  restaurant  by  two  of  his  white  American fellow  workers.  This  attempt  to  transplant  American  racism  to Soviet soil was met with outrage.  It was  made a political issue of high  order  by  the  Soviet  trade  unions  and  Party  organizations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Factory  meetings  were  called  throughout  the  Soviet  Union which  denounced  this  crime and  expressed the outrage of Soviet workers.  They  adopted  resolutions  which  were  sent  to  Tractorstroi.  The slogan of the day became, “American technique yes! </p>
<p class="calibre1">American race prejudice no!” It was given the widest publicity; the culprits were arrested immediately, not for assault and battery but for  white  chauvinsim,  a  social  crime  and  therefore  far  more serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A mass public trial, with delegations sent from factories all over the country, was held. The white technicians were sentenced to two years  imprisonment  which  was  commuted  to  deportation  to  the United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Pravda,  Izvestia</i>  and  all  of  the  provincial  papers  carried editorials  summing  up  the  lessons  of  the  trial.  In  the  building up  of  our  industries,  they  said,  we  expected  many  foreign workers to come to the country on contract to help fulfill the Five Year Plan. They would inevitably bring with them their prejudices from  the  capitalist  world.  Thus  it  was  necessary  for  the  Soviet workers  to  maintain  vigilance  against  all  forms  of  racism  and nationalism  which  must  be  sternly  rebuffed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robinson  himself  remained  in  the  Soviet  Union  where  he became a citizen and eventually an engineer. Later he was a deputy to  the  Moscow  Soviets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember the Robinson incident well. At the time it occurred, some  of  us  from  the  school  were  in  a  restaurant.  A  group  of Russians  seated  near us  pointed to us and exchanged comments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  heard  about  that  shameful  thing  that  happened  at TractorstoiT*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our very presence reminded  them  of the incident.  People were very  sympathetic  to  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  incident  was  a  dramatic affirmation by Soviet  workers of their country’s  position  on  the  question  of race  prejudice. </p>

<p class="calibre1">MY  LAST YEAR  IN  THE SOVIET  UNION</p>
<p class="calibre1">341</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just a few days  later,  Ina, her mother and fellow students from the school  accompanied  me  down to the  White Russian Station, where I entrained  for Berlin.  From there, after a short stopover, 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">journeyed  to  Paris  and  then  embarked  at  LeHavre for  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The long voyage gave me plenty of time for reflection on my stay in  the  Soviet  Union.  I  thought  of how I  would  put into practice some  of  the  lessons  learned  during  my  four-and-a-half-year stay  there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The initial theoretical framework  had  been set up—now began the  difficult  task  of testing it  in  practice.  How would we build a national  revolutionary movement  of Blacks  in close alliance with the  revolutionary  working  class  movement?  What  would  be the problems in organizing Blacks? What resistance to the Cl position would  I find  within the Party’s ranks?  These were but a few of the questions  that  passed  through  my  mind  as  1  headed  home. </p>
