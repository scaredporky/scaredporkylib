<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">8th Convention of the CPUS A</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Eighth  Convention of tbe CPUSA was  held  in  Cleveland, Ohio,  April  2-8,  1934.  It  convened  in  a  world  situation  of rising fascism  and  growing  threat  of war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler had  come to power in Germany the year before and  had embarked  on  a  campaign  of  imperialist  aggression.  He  had promoted  a  fascist  coup  in  Austria  and  had  reoccupied  the Rhineland.  In  Asia,  his  Japanese  imperial  allies  had  overrun northeast China as a first step toward establishing their “Asian Coprosperity Sphere” which envisioned the conquest of Asia and the Pacific.  Mussolini  was  planning the  invasion  of Ethiopia  which took  place the  following year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At home,  the economic crisis had passed  its lowest ebb in  1933 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and had  now  leveled off into a deep-going depression.  There was no  recovery  in sight  as  a high rate of unemployment  persisted.  It was  hecoming  clear that  Roosevelt's New  Deal and the National Industrial  Recovery  Act  (NIRA)  were  attempts  to  bridge  the most  difficult  period  for the  monopoly capitalists  and  begin  the restoration  of their  profits.  This  was indicated  in  the  enormous bounties  being  poured  out  by  the  Reconstruction  Finance Corporation,  and  the  ruinous  effects  of inflation  and  price  fixing in reducing the  workers'  real  wages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Workers,  however,  were  fighting  back  in  an  unprecedented display  of  militancy  and  solidarity  involving  whites,  Blacks, women,  youth,  skilled  and unskilled  workers,  native and foreign</p>

<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF THE  CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">417</p>
<p class="calibre1">bom.  A  strike  wave  had  engulfed  the  entire  nation with  over a million  workers  on  strike  in  1934,  the  biggest  mass  upheaval  of workers  in  the  history  of the  country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  arrived  in  Cleveland  several  days  early  and  stopped  at  the Black  YMCA  on  Euclid  Avenue.  I  spent  these days  putting the finishing  touches  on  my  report  on  the  Party’s  Afro-American work.  As  head  of  the  CP’s  Negro  Department,  it  was  my responsibility to  present such a report to the Eighth Convention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before I  arrived  in  Cleveland  I  had attended the convention of District  Sixteen  in  Birmingham,  Alabama.  District  conventions were  held  throughout  tbe  country  in  the  few  weeks  before  the national  gathering.  These  meetings  summed  up  the  pre-convention  discussion  which  had  begun  six  months  earlier  with  the publication  of the  draft  resolution  on  the  work  and  tasks  of the Party.  The  draft  was discussed  at  all  levels;  shop and street  units and  sections.  Amendments  were  formulated  and  disagreements argued  out.  Delegates  to the Eighth Convention were also elected at  the  district  meetings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I arrived promptly on Monday morning April 2, at the Prospect Avenue  auditorium  where  tbe  convention  was  to  be  held.  The auditorium  was  located  in  a  once  proud  but  now  crisis-stricken residential  neighborhood.  Delegates  from all parts of the country were arriving.  After registering,  I  began circulating among them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The composition of the delegates was impressive. There were a number of older  Party veterans  whose faces I  already  knew.  But I he  majority  seemed  relatively young,  rank-and-file leaders fresh Irom  the  struggles.  They  appeared  expectant  and  eager,  self-confidently girding for a new push towards the revolutionary goals outlined  in  the  draft  resolution.  They  were  gathered  in  groups, exchanging  experiences.  Among the 233 regular delegates  were a significant  percentage  of  Blacks  (thirty-nine  altogether).1  In  my position  as  head  of  the  Negro  Department,  I  had  become ncquainted  with  a great  number of the Party’s  Black cadre—or I had  at  least known  of their work.  But it was  heartening to sec so many  new  faces  among them.  I was particularly happy to see the delegation  of  sharecroppers  from  Tallapoosa  County.  Their spokesman  appeared  to be Eula Gray,  the niece of Ralph Gray—</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sharecropper who had been killed at the Camp Hill shoot-out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  believe  I  had  met  her  at  the  home  of Tom  Gray  the  summer before.  She  was  a  lively  and  attractive  young  woman,  with  big bright  eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later  in the convention,  she was to give a rousing report to the delegates  on  the  activities  of  the  Tallapoosa  County  Young Communist  League.  Describing the work of the youth cadres, she stated  that the youth made up 2,000 of the 6,000  members of the Sharecroppers  Union.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">As  she  ended  her  speech  she  led  the  delegates  in  singing  a revolutionary  version  of  the  old  spiritual  “We  Shall  Not  Be Moved”:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Lenin  is  our teacher, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">We shall not  be moved. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Just  like a  tree  that*s standing by  the  water,</i> <i class="calibre4">We shall not  be moved! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A1  Murphy,  secretary  of  the  Sharecroppers  Union,  was  also present.  As  usual,  he  maintained  a low profile,  pushing the local leaders  to the  fore.  There  were  also delegates from  the  fraternal parties  of  Cuba,  Mexico  and  Canada,  among  others.  To  my surprise  and  pleasure  1  saw  among  them  my  old  Lenin  School classmate, the Irishman Sean Murray.  He had come to the U.S. to bring  greetings  from  the  recently-organized  Irish  Communist Party, of which he was general secretary, and to tour the country to rally support  for  a united  independent  Ireland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Langston  Hughes, an important figure in the Black renaissance of  the  twenties,  had  recently  returned  from  a  year’s  stay  in  the Soviet  Union.  He  composed  a  poem—"Put  One  More *S’  in the USA”—especially for the convention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The convention opened with a gigantic mass rally on the night of April 2. The main hall of the auditorium was packed with delegates and  visitors.  Among  the  speakers  were  Robert  Minor,  Max Bedacht,  James  Ford  and  Clarence  Hathaway.  Bill  Foster,  the Party  chairman,  was  unable  to  attend  since  he  had  not  fully recovered  from  a  heart  attack  suffered  in  the  1932  election campaign.  He  sent  a  message  which  was  read  and  greeted  with</p>

<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF THE  CPUS A</p>
<p class="calibre1">419</p>
<p class="calibre1">thunderous applause  -as was  the draft  reply which  wished him a speedy  recovery and  quick  return  to the front lines of the hattle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  meeting  adopted  a  manifesto  calling  upon  The  workers  to take  the revolutionary way out of the crisis  in the fight for bread and  work  and  against  war  and  fascism.'*3</p>
<p class="calibre1">The business sessions opened on the morning of April 3 with the election of a presiding committee. The stage was dominated by the backdrop of a  mural showing a mighty worker's arm wielding the axe  of the  united  class  struggle  bursting the  chains  of capitalist oppression. Cheers and a standing ovation greeted the nomination of  honorary  members  of  the  presidium,  among  whom  were included Joseph  Stalin,  Ernst  Thaelmann (German leader  imprisoned  by  the  Nazis)  and  Georgi  Dimitrov,  the  hero  of  the Reichstag  trial.  He  had  exposed  the flimsy frame-up of the Nazi criminals and his release had been forced by international protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  mood  of  the  delegates  was  enthusiastic,  eager,  expectant and determined  We felt then that the country teetered on the edge  of a  revolutionary  upsurge—on  the  eve  of historic,  revolutionary struggles.  Thus,  we  prepared  for  battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  main task of the convention was mapping out a strategy to win the masses to the revolutionary way out of the crisis. Browder, the Party's general  secretary,  stepped  forth.  How  this task was to be  accomplished  was  the  central  thrust  of  his  five-hour  report, frequently  interrupted  by  applause.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  dramatic  analysis  of  the  world  and  domestic  situation, Browder  stated:  “Our  task  is  to  win  the  majority  of the  working  class  to  our  program.  We  do  not  have  unlimited  time  to accomplish this goal.  Tempo,  speed of development of our work, becomes the decisive factor in determining victory or defeat.  For fascism  is  rearing  its  ugly head  more  holdly every day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking the line of the Thirteenth Plenum of the ECCI, he said: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The world stands  on the hrink  of revolution  and wars.  Even the United  States, still the strongest fortress of world capitalism,  has been stripped of its last shred of ‘exceptionalism,’ and  stands fully exposed  to  the fury  of the storms  of crisis." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  went  on  to expose the first phase of Roosevelt's New Deal program. “Roosevelt promises to feed the hungry by reducing the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p442"></a><img src="index-442_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">production of food.  He promises to redistribute wealth by billions in subsidies  to  the  banks  and  corporations.  He gives  help  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">'forgotten  man’  hy  speeding  up  the  process  of  monopoly  and trustification.  He would  increase purchasing power of the masses through  inflation  which  gives  them  a  dollar  worth  only  sixty cents...he  restores  the  faith  of  the  masses  in  democracy  by beginning  the  introduction  of fascism.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  recording  the  Party’s  substantive  gains  since  the  last convention,  Browder  went  on  to  list  its  immediate  tasks  in  the current period.  He called for an extension of the united front from below, with its only condition being unity in struggle, and a fusion for  the  fight  for  immediate,  partial  demands  with  the  revolutionary fight for the overthrow of capitalism. In line with this task, he  urged  a  sharpened  attack  against  the  AFL  bureaucracy,  the Socialist  Party  and  all  reformist  and  renegade  groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  Black  struggle,  Browder  called  for  strengthening  the Party’s work among Blacks in basic industry—steel, coal, packing houses  and  marine.  The  Black  worker  should  be  organized  into revolutionary  trade  unions  around  issues  of job  discrimination and  democratic  trade  union  rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  urged  an  accelerated  fight  against  lynching  and  for  the freedom of the Scottsboro Boys and Angelo Herndon. In addition, it was the job of the Party to raise the slogan of equal rights and for the  right  of self-determination  in  the  Black  Belt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But these  tasks  could  only be fulfilled,  Browder asserted,  with an  uncompromising  fight  against  the  main  danger—white chauvinism.  It  was  also  necessary  to  fight  against  petty  bourgeois nationalist  tendencies  among  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  close  of  his  speech  Browder  called  for  a  party  rooted among  the  workers  and  toiling  farmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  Browder  had outlined the general priorities regarding the Black struggle, it was my job, as reporter for the Central Committee on  the  question,  to  elaborate  in  detail and  clear  up  some  of the confusion around Black reformism and petty bourgeois nationalism.5 This was  particularly important  because for the first time in the  Party’s  history,  we  had  to  fight  a significant  petty  bourgeois nationalist  deviation  which  was  surfacing within our  own ranks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p443"></a><img src="index-443_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION OF  THE  CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">421</p>
<p class="calibre1">The general revolutionary perspective outlined by Browder on the Afro-American question meant a sharpened clash with the forces of  Black  reformism—in  both  its  assimilationist  and  nationalist forms. This reformist ideology was the main obstacle in the road to achieving  the  hegemony  of  Black  workers  in  the  liberation struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  now  a  “we”  or  “they”  situation,  I  maintained.  My assessment of this situation came out of the Party’s experience in its </p>
<p class="calibre1">three-year </p>
<p class="calibre1">struggle </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">free  the  Scottsboro  Boys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottsboro  represented  our  first  serious  challenge  to  recognised  Black  reformist  leadership.  The  activities  of the  reformist leuders  had  increased  in  direct  proportion  to  the increase of our revolutionary influence among the  masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Party’s strategy at the time was to wrest hegemony from the reformists  and  win the  leadership  of Black  workers  in  the  Black freedom  front.  The  Black  proletariat,  led  by  its  communist vunguard,  was  then  (and  remains  today)  the   <i class="calibre4">only</i> class that can unite  the  broad  masses  of  Black  people  and  give  the  freedom struggle a consistently anti-imperialist content and character, thus building  its  alliance  with  the  working  class  as  a  whole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  carry  out  this  strategy,  it  was  important  for  us  to understand  that  the  attitude  of  the  Black  bourgeoisie  toward imperialism  is  not  uniform.  On  the  one  hand,  there  is  a  capitulatory, compromising and, in this country, assimilationist trend; and  on the other, a nationalist, sort of ghetto bourgeois tendency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The main social base of this latter trend is among the ghetto petty bourgeoisie—small businessmen, the intelligentsia, ministers, professionals and the like who are the most outspoken representatives of  bourgeois  nationalist  movements.  Both  trends  arc in  essence reformist,  as  they  seek  a  solution  to  the  question  within  the fmmework of the existing imperialist-dominated social structure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Permit  me a  brief digression to describe the disposition of class forces in the Black community as they existed at the time. I would any  here  that  my  analysis  benefits  somewhat  from  hindsight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1934,  the  dominant  tendency  of  Black  reformism  was bourgeois  assimilationism,  reflecting  the  strivings and  ambitions of the top layers of what DuBois called the“talented tenth.” These</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p444"></a><img src="index-444_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">422</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">elites  were  wealthy  professionals,  a  sprinkling  of  successful businessmen,  top-echelon leaders, upper-braeket educators, local politicians  and  the  like.  Centered  in  the  top  leadership  of  the NAACP,  Urban  League and associate organizations,  their orientation  for  progress was via acceptance into the white world. They saw  the  solution  through a slow  evolutionary process under the henevolent  auspiees  of  enlightened  imperialism  and  its  liberal detachment.  Supporters  of this  trend  tend  to  be staunchly  antinationalist  and  can  only  see  advancement  for  Blacks  through aping  the  white  establishment</p>
<p class="calibre1">The influenee of the top assimilationist group within the Black movement  derived  not  from  its  economic  strength,  but  from  its control  of  the  main  media  of  mass  influence  in  the  Blaek community:  the  press  and  administration  of  educational  and cultural  insitutions.  It  had  strings  extending  into  the top  leadership of the whole complex of Black life on all its levels; ministerial alliances, professional and fraternal organizations, women’s clubs and  the  like.  They  received  heavy  support  in  the  columns  and editorials of the big capitalist press and were the main dispensers of white  ruling  class  patronage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1940,  DuBois  criticized  the  NAACP  leadership  because  it regarded the “organization as a weapon to attack the sort of social discrimination  that  especially  irks  them,  rather  than  as  an organization to improve the status and power of the whole Negro group.”6</p>
<p class="calibre1">1  pointed  out  in  my  report  that  they  believe  the  “fate  of the Negro  masses  is  bound  up  with  the  maintenance  of capitalism.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  view  of  course  “implies  the  collaboration  with  the  white imperialist  rulers,  or  in  the  words  of  the  N.A.A.C.P.  leaders, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘united front of the best elements of both races.’ ” This type of front could only be built in opposition to “the rising movement of Negro and  white  toilers,  particularly  against  its  leaders—the  communists.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  it  was  the  white  liberal  elements  within  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">bourgeoisie  who  launched  the  NAACP  in  1911  and  thenceforward held  veto power over all its decisions. They intervened in the movement when the Booker T. Washington Tuskegee machine</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p445"></a><img src="index-445_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF THE CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">423</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  under  heavy  fire  from  the  Young  Turks  of  the  Niagara Movement  led  by  W.E.B.  DuBois  and  Monroe  Trotter,  Big busi ness, alerted  of the  danger  to  “sane”  leadership  represented by an  uncontrolled  Blaek  movement, rushed forces to the danger spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  young  intellectuals  of the  Niagara  Movement  were  overwhelmed  with  new  imperialist  pleaders  for  its  cause.  They were subject  to  sustained  wooing  by  humanitarian millionaires, </p>
<p class="calibre1">baeked  up  by  hard  cash  in  the  form  of  subsidies  to  Black education,  health  and  religious  projects.  Wealthy  white  liberal philanthropists like Joel Spingam and Mary WhiteOvington held decisive  positions  of  leadership  in  the  organization.  Its  cirele  of supporters included millionaires like Mrs. Cyrus McCormiek and Harvey  Firestone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Ralph  Bunche  aptly  observed, ‘T h e N.A.A.C.P.  propelled by  dominant  white  hands  embarked  upon  the  eivil  libertarian course  that  the  Negro-inspired  Niagara  movement  had  futilely tried  to  navigate.’"7</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  leadership  of the  NAACP  is  a  self-perpetuating  one with ties  direetly  to  Wall  Street  and  soeial  democrats  like  A.  Philip Randolph—as well as in more recent years, to trade union bureaucrats.8  This assimilationist  stratum has not ceased  to offer opposition on domestic issues, nor has it surrendered its claims to speak for Blacks.  But it is its support for monopoly capitalism and belief in the possibility of peaceful, legal, full integration into the system that  determines  the  boundaries  and  character  of its  opposition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is tbe core of Negro bourgeois reformism. From this flows its tactieal  line of reliance on  bourgeois courts,  legislative bodies, its treacherous  compromises  with  the  white  ruling  class,  its  reactionary sabotage of the revolutionary struggles for Negro rights.’’9</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  bourgeois  nationalist  tendency  had  its  economic  roots  in the  ohjcctive  position  of  the  Black  bourgeoisie  and  its  peculiar conditions  of  a  stunted  development  within  the  structure  of monopoly  capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confronted  by overwhelming competition,  Black business was marginal and non-industrial in character, mainly retail and service industries.  Even  here,  it  was  restricted  to the leftovers of the big</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p446"></a><img src="index-446_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">424</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalist  chain  enterprises  and  economically  sounder  white establishments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  result  of  this  peculiar  position,  the  Black  ghetto  bourgeoisie  (mainly  a  petty  bourgeoisie)  found  itself  caught  in  an inescapable bind.  On the one hand,  it had what  bas  been called a vested  interest  in  segregation,  upon  which  it  was  economically dependent  for  its  market.  At the same time, it  found segregation the chief obstacle to its social development. It was torn between its immediate  economic  interest  which dictated  maintenance  of the ghetto  as  its  main  base  of  operation  and  its  desire  for  social equality.  Tbe  result  was  a  split  personality  created  hy mutually exclusive  desires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I wrote in  <i class="calibre4">Negro Liberation</i> in  1948, “The Negro upper class came  late  to  the  scene  of  American  economic  development... </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  the  key  points  of the country’s  economic  life  were already dominated  by  big  business/’10</p>
<p class="calibre1">Its  leaders  sought  to  rally the  masses  through appeals  to  race solidarity, cooperation and loyalty, for a “buy Black” policy. They attempted  thereby  to  foster  a  kind  of  Black  exclusivism  which would  objectively  run  parallel  to  the  segregationist  policy of the white  power  elite.  Tbe  less  affluent  sections  of the  petty  bourgeoisie  act  as  the  most  aggressive  spokesmen  of  this  type  of bourgeois  nationalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  militancy  of  this  stratum  is  very  misleading  and  in  fact posed a real danger to the Party at the time. I felt it most important to  point  this  out  to  the  delegates; While apparently voicing opposition to the official bourgeois reformist  leadership,  these petty  bourgeois  nationalist  leaders  objectively  represent  the  interests  of  the  bourgeoisie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, objectively these movements reflect an attempt on the part of the petty bourgeois leaders to seize the leadership of the rising movement of the Negro masses against oppression  in  order  to  throttle  it  by  diverting  it  into  reactionary utopian  channels,  away  from  revolutionary  struggle  and hence  back into the fold of the  bourgeois reformists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This self-isolationist tendency has been expressed in a plethora of projects  for  building  a  Black  economy  within  the  walls  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p447"></a><img src="index-447_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION OF THE  CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">425</p>
<p class="calibre1">segregation.  In  times  of relative prosperity,  this tendency existed side  by side with the dominant assimilationist  trend  as  a more  or less steady  undercurrent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in hard times, times of economic depression, this stratum, as a result of its weak and tenuous economic position, is forced to the wall  of  bankruptcy.  As  the  economic  conditions  of  the  ghetto masses (upon which they depend) deteriorate—their strivings are blocked.  Sections of them, driven to despair, frequently fall under the  influence  of  utopian  and  messianic  leaders  who  raise  the banner  of  race  solidarity  and  develop  mass  movements  of  a separatist  character.  Such  was the  base of the Garvey  movement and  others  which  followed  World  War  I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The growth of Garveyism came as a result of the crisis of Black reformism when organizations like the NAACP found themselves without a program to meet the needs of the masses. The end of the post-war  economic  crisis  was  followed  by  a  period  of  partial capitalist stabilization and  relative prosperity in the latter half of the  twenties.  This witnessed the decline of the Garvey  movement and  the  comeback  of the  NAACP  to  the leadership  scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But its hegemony was only short lived. The crisis of 1929 found the  old  guard  again  in  crisis.  Again  there  was  an  upsurge  of separatist  trends, expressing the desperation of the ghetto nationalists.  Again  there  was  a  breakaway  of the  middle  strata  which comprised its rank and file and lower-echelon leaders. By the mid-thirties, these defections had reached  into the top echelons of the organization,  resulting in the resignation of Dr.  DuBois from the NAACP,  Unfortunately,  his  defection  was  not  to  the  rising revolutionary  forces,  but  rather  toward  petty  bourgeois  nationalism.  (By  the  fifties,  however,  DuBois  had  been  won to  proletarian  revolution  and  was  a firm  supporter  of socialism.) But this time, a new force had entered the arena of the liberation struggle.  Since the Garvey movement,  a Black working class had emerged as an  independent class force.  Its advanced detachment, including  many  former  Garvey  militants,  was  the  Communist Party,  with  a  revolutionary  program  and  strategy  for  Black liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  furnished  the  leadership  for  a  new,  national  revolutionary</p>

<p class="calibre1">trend.  It  was  primarily  because  of the  rapid  growth  of this  new force  that  the  ghetto  nationalist  wave  which  swept  the  Black communities  in  the  early  thirties  did  not  coalesce  into  a  single organization with a unified  program and  a national  center as did the  Garvey  movement  in  the  post-war  decade.  This  time it  was manifested  in  a  series of mainly local-based  movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  main  theme  of  my  report  was  the  call  for  a  stepped  up ideological  struggle  against  bourgeois  reformism  and  its  reactionary  programs  and  policies in  the  current  crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  called  attention  to  the  treacherous  activities  of the NAACP </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Urban  League leadership which had greeted the New Deal as virtually  another  emancipation  proclamation.  1  pointed out that the “clear-cut bourgeois reformist movements such as the NAACP </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  National  Urban  League...with  their  openly  declared policies of collaboration with  the white ruling class’* were not the majin  danger.  To  a  large  extent,  they  had  already  lost  the confidence of the  masses.  Our immediate problem  lay in the new neo-Garvcyist  movements  which  were  spreading  like  brushfire through the Black communities. These appealed to the nationalist mood  among  the  masses  and  advocated  the wildest  reactionary schemes  as  a  way  out  of the  misery  and  suffering  of the  ghetto masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  briefly analyzed some of these movements against  which “we would  have  to  direct  our  fire  in  the  coming  period.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  noted  three  types  of  such  movements.  For  example,  the Nationalist  Movement  for  the  Establishment  of  a  49th  State, headquartered  in  Chicago.  The  leaders  of this  organization held that  Black oppression and racism in this country were natural and inevitable. Therefore they proposed that “the Federal government acquire  a territory from the existing  States (adequate in size and fertile  in  soil)  and  dispose  of  this  land  its  resources  to  Negroes willing to settle.” This defeatist scheme, according to its advocates, would not  only solve the problem but, we were informed, “will do much to relieve the economic stress throughout the country due to the vast  oversupply  of workers  who  can’t  find  work.” 11</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  movement  of this  type,  also  originating  in  Chicago, was the  Peace  Movement  to  Liberia.  The  leaders  of this organi-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p449"></a><img src="index-449_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF THE  CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">427</p>
<p class="calibre1">ration  claimed  four  million  members  who  had  signed  a petition addressed  to  the  president,  asking  that  the  government  pay the expense of Blacks" transportation  to  Liberia or Ethiopia to settle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  signers  of the  petition,  according to the  leaders,  stated  that M</p>
<p class="calibre1">ibey  hold  themselves  in  readiness  to  be  eliminated  from  the impossihly  competitive  labor  market  here  by  transportation  in government  transports  to  Africa,”12</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further,  they  stated,  an  exodus  of the  poorest  people  would benefit  both  races,  improve labor conditions for those remaining, nnd  promote the  long deferred  economic recovery.  Emphasizing I lie  peaceful,  non-revolutionary  character  of  the  movement,  its ultcr subservience to imperialism, its advocates asserted that their Nchcme  entailed  no complication with foreign imperialist  powers and they were not out to set up an independent state but to become </p>
<p class="calibre1">“law-abiding” citizens  in  their  newly-adopted  countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  clear  that  these  schemes  fit  precisely  into  the  whole program  of the most  racist  and  reactionary elements, such as the infamous  Senator  Bilbo  of Mississippi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  considered  that  perhaps  the  most  dangerous  of  these  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">movements  was  the  so-called  Jobs  for  Negroes  movement.  It cropped  up  in  many  different  cities  under  different  names.  In Harlem  it  was  called  the  Sufi  movement  and  was  led  by  the notorious  Abdul-Hamid  Sufi;  in  Baltimore  it  appeared  as  the C’oKtini  Movement;  in  Washington,  D .C ,  it  was  the  Negro Alliance.  The  local  nationalist  leaders  (and  very  often  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">"leaders” saw the movement as a remunerative hustle) all followed a  similar  plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They focused  their  struggle  for  more jobs  on  the  small  white-owned  businesses  and  shops  which  refused  to  hire  Blacks.  The policy of a small firm’s excluding  Blacks from employment while selling  products  in  the  ghetto  created  a  great  deal  of anger  and animosity among Blacks. The Jobs for Negroes movement thrived oil  this justly  felt  anger.  But  by directing the struggle exclusively against these small establishments, which had only a small fraction of jobs, the broad struggle of Black unemployed was diverted away Irom the large corporations which were located mostly outside the ghetto. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p450"></a><img src="index-450_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">428</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">These  movements tended to quickly  become anti-white, seeing the  enemy  as  the  white  workers  who  held  jobs  in  the  ghetto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Demands such as “All jobs for Blacks in Harlem,” were common. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ruling class  was  overjoyed  with  this type of movement.  It did not attack the real enemy nor raise demands for jobs, equality and  the  end  to  discrimination  where  the  main  masses  of Blacks worked  and  where  the  majority  of the jobs  were.  Instead  they sought to divert the struggle for jobs from the real enemy to white workers  and  aggravated  racial divisions  precisely at a time when conditions  and  potential  for  a  united  struggle  were very great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  more  sinister  was  the  Pacific  Movement  for the Eastern World.  It  had  as  its main  slogan “United  Front of Darker Races under the leadership of Japan.” The movement developed directly in connection  with the threat of war between the U.S. and Japan, and was basically the work of the Japanese imperialist agents who were attempting to  divert the  growing  national  liberation  movement  of Blacks  into  support  for Japanese  imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its  program  for  race  unity,  as  opposed  to  working class unity and  the  unity  of  all  toilers  against  imperialism,  found  support among  some  sections  of  Black  petty  bourgeois  intellectuals  and even  some  workers.  This  movement  was  particularly poisonous because  of  the  racial  and  chauvinist  propaganda,  attempting  to convince  Blacks  that  Japan  was  the  “champion  of  the  darker races.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In practice this movement ran counter to the real interests of the Black  masses  and,  in  many cities,  was  an  obstacle to  the organization of struggle for immediate demands. A good example was in St.  Louis  where  leaders  of the  Pacific  Movement  were  active in attempting  to  defeat  a  strike  of  Black  and  white  nut  pickers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The third tendency was the Liberian-American Plan, which was a clearly hourgeois expression of Pan-Africanism. Under the guise of assistance to Liberia (their slogan was “Freedom for Liberia!”), it was a plan of the aspirant  Black bourgeoisie to  participate in a comprador  role  in  the colonial exploitation of Liberia.  Ib is can be seen in the statements of one of its leaders: “We are beating our hearts  and  souls  trying to  break through thick walls of prejudice which  bar  us  from  the  higher  brackets  of  big  industry  here  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p451"></a><img src="index-451_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF THE  CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">429</p>
<p class="calibre1">America,  when  there  is  a  virgin  field  which  we  could  develop in Africa.”13 The so-called  plan to free Liberia carefully avoided any mention  of the  role  of  U.S.  imperialism  (Firestone  owned  huge rubber  plantations in Liberia)  in the exploitation  of the  Liberian people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  plan  received  a large amount  of publicity throughout the Black-owned  media.  Its appeal to the impoverished Black masses was mainly that a “Free Liberia” could show the way to improving the  conditions  of  “colored  folk”  throughout  the  world.  The propaganda  was  aimed  at  the  ghetto  petty  bourgeoisie—themselves  driven  into  poverty by the  Depression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  movement  found  its  own  theoreticians  to justify  such  a scheme,  cloaking  it  in  pseudo-revolutionary  terms  designed  to appeal  to  poverty-stricken  Blacks,  Foremost  among these  theoreticians was the renegade George Padmore, apostate communist, whose  numerous  articles  appeared  throughout the Black  press.14</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  a  credit  to  the  Party’s  correct  strategy  and tactics in  the Black freedom front, along with our revolutionary line, that these tendencies  remained  as  scattered,  local  organizations,  never able to  unite  nationally  as  Garvey’s  UNI A  had.  We  knew  that  to maintain their credibility among the masses, these nationalists had in  some  way  to  struggle  against  the  system.  To  this  extent,  we would  unite with them in a principled  way, while criticizing their idealist  schemes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  purpose  in  this  was to  better be  in  a  position  to  lead  the broad  masses,  many  of  whom,  having  genuine  national  aspirations,  were  temporarily  taken  in  by  these  utopian  escapist nationalists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PETTY  BOURGEOIS  NATIONALISM IN THE  PARTY</p>
<p class="calibre1">From this account of the programs and activities of the various brands  of  utopian  Black  nationalism,  I  addressed  myself to  the struggle  against  the ideological influences of these movements in the  Party.  This  was a  touchy  question.  It  was  the first  time  this question had been dealt with in such a forthright manner. We had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p452"></a><img src="index-452_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">430</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoken much of white chauvinism, the main danger, and our tasks in  relation  to  it.  There  had  been  a considerable strengthening of this  fight,  but  there  was  still  much  room for  improvement.  But little had  been said about  petty  bourgeois nationalism within our own ranks.  It was not surprising that the pressure of the growing wave of “ghetto nationalism” should find expression in the Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a tendency among some Black comrades to surrender to the propaganda of the local  nationalists.  This was revealed  in St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Louis  in  connection  with  the  pro-Japanese  movement  and  in Harlem  in  respect  to the  Jobs for Negroes  campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, there was no Chinese wall between the Party and the masses.  Just  as  the ruling class ideology of white supremacy had its  influences  on  white  comrades,  it  was  not  unusual  that  Black comrades would he similarly affected by petty  bourgeois nationalist  ideology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  moods  and  sentiments  were  expressed  in  feelings  of distrust  of white comrades, in  skepticism about the possibility of winning white workers to active support in the struggle for Black rights, and in the attitude that nothing could be accomplished until white  chauvinism  was  completely  eliminated.  This  latter  was particularly  dangerous  because it failed to understand that white chauvinism could  only be broken down in the process of struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  more  than  a mood  or  a  sentiment  was  the  beginning  of a theoretical  rationale  represented  in  the  contention  that  even  to raise  the  question  of  bourgeois  nationalism  would  weaken  the struggle  against  white  supremacy.  I  denounced  this  dangerous counterposing of the fight against white chauvinism to the struggle against  bourgeois  nationalism.  Of course white chauvinism  was the main danger,  but communists could not be content with mere formula.  As  Stalin  bad  said  when  dealing with a similar controversy concerning great  Russian chauvinism and local nationalism in  the  Soviet  Union:</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  would  be  foolish  to  attem pt  to  give  ready-m ade  recipes suitable for all times and for all conditions as regards the chief and  the  lesser  danger.  Such  recipes  do  not  exist.  The  chief danger is the deviation against which we have ceased to fight, thereby  allowing  it  to  grow  into  a  danger  to  the  state.15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p453"></a><img src="index-453_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF THE  CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">431</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  white  chauvinism  was  the  main  danger  by  no means  implied  that  bourgeois  nationalism,  under  certain  conditions, could not become the main danger in a particular situation in the development of our work among Blacks. No one could deny that  this  was  the  situation  that  developed  in  St.  Louis  and  in Harlem.  Our experience in these struggles showed that bourgeois nationalism,  if  not  fought,  could  become  the  main  obstacle  to advancing  our work  among  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  struggle  against  white  chauvinism  and  petty  bourgeois nationalism  went  hand-in-hand.  It  was  necessary  to  struggle  on two  fronts,  for  both  deviated  from  the  line  of  proletarian internationalism.  Stalin  correctly  stated:  “If  you  want  to  keep both deviations under fire, then aim primarily against this source, against  those who  depart  from  internationalism.”16</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  tried  to  hit  home  sharply  to  the  delegates  that  the  most dangerous forms of petty  bourgeois nationalism in tbe Party were not its open expressions,  but rather its hidden forms. The clearest example was the case of Comrade Nowell in Detroit.  The Central Committee  had  definite  information  that  Nowell  had  become  a center around which these tendencies in the  Party gravitated and from  whom  comrades  who  erred  in  this  direction  found  tbe greatest encouragement.  Nowell had spread veiled inferences that some Black comrades who were carrying out the work of the Party were  Uncle Toms.  He  had  attempted  to  use  all  difficulties  and shortcomings of the  Party to disrupt  and  to undermine morale— </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly  among  the  newer comrades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  denounced  Nowell’s  activities,  charging  that  they created an atmosphere  in which  stoolpigeons  and  provocateurs could carry on  their  best  work.17</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was now at the summation of my report. It was clear, 1 said, that the struggle against reformism in the Black movement,  including bourgeois  and  petty  bourgeois  nationalist  influences,  could  go forward  only  on  the  basis  of an  all-round  strengthening  of our work  among  the  Black  masses.  The  increased  activities  of  the reformist leaders could only be met and defeated on the basis of the widest  application of our united  front tactics.  This meant that we had to penetrate reformist-led mass  organizations on the basis of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p454"></a><img src="index-454_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">432</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediate  and  specific  demands  of  the  Black  masses.  Thus we  could  draw  the  people  into  struggle  over  the  heads  of  the treacherous  reformist  and  bourgeois  nationalist  leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  whole  situation  confronted  us  with  the  necessity  of immediately  strengthening  the  leadership  of  the  proletariat  and the  Party  in  the  Black  liberation  movement.  Black  industrial workers  were  then,  and  remain  today,  the  most  powerful, resolute  and  consistently  revolutionary  force  in  the  Black movement.  It  is  only  under  their  leadership  and  that  of  its communist  vanguard  that  the  Black  united  front can maintain a consistently  anti-imperialist  character,  unite  with  the  multinational  working class,  and  eventually  overthrow  imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  a strategy  called  for  a  radical  improvement  in  our trade union and shop work.  We had to energetically take up the struggle for  the  day-toKlay  demands  of Black  workers  in  every  struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thfc also had to he done by the Unemployed Councils. On this basis we  could  immediately  carry  through  energetic  and  sustained recruitment of Black workers into our revolutionary trade unions, into  the  revolutionary  opposition  within  the  AFL.  Simultaneously,  it  was  necessary  to  carry  through  a  hold  policy  of drawing the most militant element among them into the leadership of the trade union and unemployed work.  The whole question of developing cadres  among  Blacks  had  to  he more rapidly pushed forward  in  the  Party,  as  well  as  in  the  revolutionary  mass organizations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  drive  for  the  strengthening  of our  work  among the  hasic sections  of  the  Black  working  class  was  connected  with  the intensification  of  the  struggle  along  the  whole  front  of  Black liberation.  In  this  we  had  to  immediately  push  forward  the campaign  for  Black  political  rights,  against  lynch  terror  and  all forms  of  persecution,  for  the  freedom  of  the  Scottshoro  Boys, Angelo  Herndon and others.  I called for centering this campaign around the  LSNR/s  Bill  of Civil  Rights  for the Negro  People.  A mass  petition  drive  for  the  bill  was  to  have  been  immediately launched  and connected with the development of mass actions in all  localities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  South,  we  had to strengthen  our concentration work in</p>

<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF THE  CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">433</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  key  industries—steel,  coal,  textile  and  tohacco.  We  had  to build  up the Party, revolutionary trade unions and the opposition movement within the AFL on the hasis of drawing Black and white workers  into joint struggle.  Our demands should have focused on I In*  needs  of  the  masses:  against  the  NRA  differentials,  discrimination and increased  fascist attacks upon the rights of Black mid  white  workers.  Simultaneously,  we  had  to  take  steps  to Hi l engthen  the  movement  of  sharecroppers  and  poor  farmers against  the  cotton  plow-under,  the  Bankhead  Bill—against  the whole  system  of semi-feudal  slavery  of the  agrarian  masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  necessary to further develop our revolutionary agrarian program, in the center of which must he the slogan of‘'confiscation of the land of the hig white landlords and capitalists"  in  favor  of l he  Black  and  white  tillers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  all  this  work,  it  was  necessary  to  bring  forth  more  energetically  our  full  program  for  Black  liberation:  equal  rights,  the light of self-determination and confiscation of the land. We had to carry through the widest popularization of the achievements of the Soviet Union in the solution of the national question.  Likewise, it was  important  not  only  to  popularize  the  program  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">&lt;  ommunist  International for the Black colonies in Africa and the West  Indies, but to develop actions in support of the revolutionary movement  in  these colonies  against  imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  building a united front from below with the masses of Black toilers in the reformist-led organizations, we had to guard against iitiy  leftist distortion  of our line, any tendency to lump the masses in these organizations together with their leaders. This would play directly  into  the  hands  of  petty  hourgeois  and  hourgeois  mis-Icadcrs, inevitahly leading towards our isolation. On the contrary, it  was  absolutely  necessary  in  our  approach to  these  masses  to make a  clear distinct ion  between  them  and  their  leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the same  time,  we  had  to be  equally  alert  against the right opportunist  tendency  To  underestimate  the  class  role  of  Black reformism.  Such  a tendency  would lead  to lagging at  the tail  of reformist  and  reactionary  nationalist  leaders,  weakening  proletarian  hegemony  and  Party  leadership  of  the  Black  liberation movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p456"></a><img src="index-456_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">434</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">An effective struggle  against  reformist  leaders and the winning of tbe  masses  from  their  reactionary  influence  demanded  once and for all, that we seriously take up the task of building the LSNR </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  an  independent  mass  organization  around  the  Party’s  program  of struggle  for  Black  liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  on  the  basis  of  huilding  up  our  work  along these  lines, would  we  be  able  to  weld  that  unbreakable  unity  of Black  and white  toilers.  My  report  lasted  two  hours  and  was  considered  a highlight  of  the  convention.  1  received  a  standing  ovation.  By  a motion  of a delegate from  Michigan,  my  report—’“The  Road  to Negro Liberation”—was published in pamphlet form.  I was later placed  on  the  Polithuro  as  a  result  of this  speech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">LOOKING BACK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  the  Party  could  take  the  lead  in  the  Black  liberation movement,  it  had  to  demonstrate  in  action  to  Blacks  that  their deeply  rooted  distrust  of white  workers—nurtured  by  race  riots and  discrimination,  and  encouraged  by established  leaders—was an  obstacle  to  united  action in  the crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party  was  able  to do this because it  had a comprehensive program to  deal  with  the  crisis  and  the  other groups did  not.  In Scottsboro, the Party effectively discredited the legalistic strategy of  the  NAACP—its  reliance  on  courts,  lawyers  and  liberal politicians.  It was in our day-to-day work in the northern ghettos, the  unemployment  demonstrations,  the  campaigns  against evictio n s  and  police  brutality,  and  in  struggles  to  organize  non-discriminatory  unions,  that  the  Party  won  hegemony  over  the local  bourgeois  nationalist  organizations.  Such  movements were springing  up  at  the  time  in  Chicago,  New  York,  Baltimore,  St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Louis,  Washington  and  Detroit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  nationalist  and  separatist  organizations  exploited  the antagonisms  which  inevitably  developed  between  Blacks  and white immigrants in neighboring ghettos. This was further exacerbated  hy  the  presence  of  white  immigrant  shop  keepers  in  the Black  community. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p457"></a><img src="index-457_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF  THE  CPUS A</p>
<p class="calibre1">435</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  nationalists  failed  to  take  two  factors  into  account. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  that  the  Depression  was  driving  many  of  these  white immigrant  groups  into  desperation  and  moving them  to the left; and second, that the Party was waging a relentless struggle against white chauvinism in its own ranks and in the mass organizations it participated  in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Unemployed Councils, the TUUL unions and the ILD—all active in the early Depression—enrolled large numbers of whites in struggle on the platform which proclaimed full equality for Blacks and  resistance  to  all  forms  of discrimination  in employment,  in distribution of relief and  in  the courts.  Moreover, the Scottshoro Campaign  demonstrated,  as  Adam  Clayton  Powell  pointed  out, that there were hundreds of thousands of white workers throughout  the  country  and  the  world  who  would  go  to  meetings  and demonstrations, and even get arrested to protect eight Black youth from  a  “legal  lynching.”  These  actions  helped  to  demonstrate that  the  white  workers  were  willing,  under  Party  leadership,  to struggle  against  their  own  chauvinism  and  support  the  special demands  of the  Black  liberation  struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But equally important was the fact that the Party’s program was far more effective than that of the nationalists in winning relief for the Black community in the face of unemployment and high rents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  nationalists  struggled  for  the  right  to  all  jobs  in  the  Black community,  but. most  Blacks  worked  outside  the ghetto.  Even if the  nationalists  succeeded,  the  number  of jobs  they  could  win would only reach a fraction of the Black unemployed. In contrast, the  Party’s  demonstrations,  such  as  sit-ins  at  relief offices,  won immediate relief for hundreds of thousands of unemployed Blacks in  cities  throughout  the  country—in  Birmingham,  Richmond, New  York,  Chicago—in  almost  every  major  urban  center.  The Party’s mass demonstrations  brought results,  and along with our defense of Black political prisoners and the struggle against white chauvinism, it won us the respect of the Black masses throughout America.  Large numhers  of Black workers  and intellectuals  were attracted  to  our ranks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In my position as the head of the Negro Department, I tried to guide  this  two-pronged  ideological  struggle—against  bourgeois</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p458"></a><img src="index-458_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">436</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">assimilationism  on the  one hand,  and petty  bourgeois and  bourgeois  nationalism  on  the  other.  The  success  of this  ideological struggle in the  Black community was dependent upon a relentless and  continuous  struggle  against  white  chauvinism  by  white communists and effective  practical  mass work by the Party in the north  and  South.  From  1930-35,  both of these conditions existed, and  we  became  the  single  most  effective  and  respected  organization  in the  national  Black  community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Eighth  Party  Convention  called  for  building  the  LSNR </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  a  mass  organization.  We  felt  the  need  for  a  Black-led revolutionary  organization  to  counter  the  NAACP  leaders who were  attempting  a  comeback  after  Scottsboro.  They  wanted  to divert  the  mass  trend  toward  militant  confrontation  back  into channels  of  reliance  on  capitalist  courts  and  legislative  bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards  this  end,  they  were  trumpeting  the  Costigan-Wagner Anti-Lynch  Bill in  an effort to regain their lost prestige.  Not only did  they  seek  to  confine  the  struggle  to  legislative  channels  and bolster faith in the capitalist institutions, they sought support for a hill which in effect could be used as a weapon against the struggles of workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately  upon  my  return  to  New  York  wc  launched  a campaign  to  rebuild  the  LSNR.  We  called  a  meeting  of  the national  council  of the  organization.  At  this  meeting  Langston Hughes,  who  had  recently  returned  from  the  Soviet  Union,  was elected  president.  I  was  elected  national  secretary,  relieving Richard  B.  Moore  who  was in  ill  health.  Ben  Davis,  Jr., just  up from  Atlanta,  was  made the editor  of the   <i class="calibre4">Liberator</i> (formerly the <i class="calibre4">Harlem  Liberator)</i>  which  now  became  the  official  organ  of the LSNR.  Davis  was  replacing  Maude  White  who  was  sent  to Cleveland  as  a  Party  section  organizer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">D ETRO irS  SCOTTSBORO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As a first step towards rebuilding the organization, I went on a speaking tour of midwest industrial centers and addressed successful  mass  rallies  in  Detroit,  Cleveland,  Chicago  and  St.  Louis. </p>

<p class="calibre1">EIGHTH  CONVENTION  OF  THE  CPUSA</p>
<p class="calibre1">437</p>
<p class="calibre1">These rallies were sponsored  by local LSNR groups, in some cases lolntly  witb  the  International  Labor  Defense.  The  burning civil lights  issue  in  these  cities  was  police  terror  against  the  Black community.  One of the most  glaring examples I encountered was In  Detroit.  There  the  Party  and  the  LSNR  chapter  were  in  the midst  of a campaign to defend James Victory, a Black World War 1 veteran, charged with robbery and assault with intent to murder a white woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  situation  was  huilding  up  to  a  race  riot.  Detroit  was  a virtual  company  town  of the auto  magnates  and  allied  business Interests. They controlled the government, the police and press. At the  same  time  the  city  was  a  key  concentration  of  pro-fascist elements.  Foremost  among these were Detroit’s own radio priest, Father Coughlin,  and his followers. The Rev.  Gerald L.K.  Smith, one of Huey Long’s chief lieutenants,  had also settled in Detroit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The area was also a  Ku  KJux Klan stronghold and the home base of the  notorious  Black  Legion—a split-off from the KKK.  These itnd  various  other  local  hate  groups  all  engaged  in  fanning  the llnmes  of  racial  and  national  hatred  among  the  city’s  polyglot labor force, consisting of Poles (the largest foreign-born element), ii  large  contingent  of Southern  poor  whites  and  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The frame-up of James Victory  occurred  in the midst of one of the  most  vicious  campaigns  of  racist  incitement  in  Detroit’s history.  It  was  launched  by  the  police  department  under  tbe leadership  of Colonel  Pickert,  in conjunction with  the employer-controlled  press  of the  city.  For  two  weeks  the  news  media  and especially the yellow sheet, the  <i class="calibre4">Detroit  Times, </i>  carried on a vicious drive  of slanderous race^haiting in which  Blacks were depicted as natural  rapists,  voodooists,  murderers  and  all-round  thugs  who were  conspiring to  assault white  women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  police  department  issued  special  instructions to  arrest  on sight  Blacks found in white  neighborhoods.  Col.  Pickert  boasted that  an  average  of  fifty  arrests  a  day  were  made.  This  frenzied manhunt  finally  culminated  in  the  arrest  and  frame-up of James Victory,  who was made a target  for the whole campaign  of lynch hysteria. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The local  LSNR and  the ILD immediately came to the defense</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Victory.  When I arrived they were in the process  of building  a united front defense committee.  From the outset, we saw that the terror campaign and the frame-up of the innocent worker Victory had  a  two-fold  purpose;  on  the  one  hand,  to  intensify  the oppression  of  Blacks  and  on  the  other,  to  divide  and  split  the workers  and  in  this  way  to  forestall  the growing  tide of working class  struggle  against  the  auto  lords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The defense committee formulated demands which included an immediate  end  to  the  terror campaign  and  manhunt,  immediate release of Victory, withdrawal of special police details from Black neighborhoods,  freedom  of  speech  and  movement  for  Black people in all parts of the city, an end to discrimination in relief and on the job, and  a call for united action of Black and white toilers against  the  common  oppressor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  series  of  meetings  were  called,  resolutions  and  telegrams poured  down  on  the  city  officials.  A  tremendous  mass  struggle developed  to  defend  Victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  spoke  at  a  large  mass  rally  held  at  the Israel  Baptist Church along with  Rev.  Graham, John  Bollens of the Union Theological Seminary,  and  William  Wcinstone,  district  organizer  of  the Communist  Party,  I  remember  comrades  at  this  meeting  and activists in the campaign included Joe Billups, bead of the LSNR </p>
<p class="calibre1">chapter;  LeBron  Simmons,  a  young  Black  law  student  and  his brother John; and Nat Ganicy, trade union director for the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  my speech I  placed  the defense of James Victory in the context of the  overall  struggle for  Black  rights,  emphasizing that success could  only  be  achieved  through  revolutionary  mass  struggle  of Black  and  white  workers.  I  scored  Black  reformists  who  stood aloof  from  the  struggle  and  refused  to  say  anything  ahout  the crying  injustices  and  insults  perpetrated  against  Black  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  committee  retained  the  famous  labor  attorney  Maurice Sugar to defend James Victory. At the trial, Sugar made a brilliant and  militant  defense,  breaking  down the  prosecution's  lies  and fabrications  and  exposing  the  flimsy  character  of the  frame-up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mass protest, combined with Sugar's legal defense, resulted in the  freeing  of  James  Victory.  This  important  triumph  was testimony to the  need for mass struggle in defense of Black rights</p>

<p class="calibre1">439</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  stood  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  reformist  treachery  of  the NAACP  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I left Detroit in high spirits.  My next stop was Chicago, where I addressed  a  mass  meeting  called  by  the  American  Consolidated Trades  Council.  The  meeting  was  part  of  a  campaign  for employment  of Black construction workers on the DuSable High School  building  project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chicago  was  followed  by  stops  in  St.  Louis,  Cleveland  and Kansas City.  Following the tour, there was a short spurt of activity by LSNR chapters, but this soon petered out. Soon the only active chapters left were in Harlem and the Southxide of Chicago. It was not long before it became clear to me that the LSNR as a national organization  was  dead  and  could  not  be revived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What had happened? Why had the LSNR never really gotten off the  ground  as  a  broad,  mass  organization? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its  failure  was  inevitable,  inherent  in  the organizational structure  and  program  of  the  LSNR  as  it  had  been  conceived.  Its founding conference in the fall of 1930 had adopted a program and manifesto  which  included  the  full  program  of  the  Communist Party on the Afro-American question, including destruction of the plantation  system,  confiscation  of  land  without  compensation, and right of self-determination  in tbe Black Belt. It had called for affiliation  of  other  organizations  to  the  LSNR  on  the  basis  of support  for  this  complete  program.  The  obvious  result  of these rigid  demands  was  that  no  other  groups  would affiliate with the LSNR.  LSNR  branches  of  individual  members  were  small, sectarian  groups  made  up  almost  entirely  of  CP  members  and close sympathizers.  Little effort was made to huild the LSNR as a true united front  body,  organizing joint actions around immediate issues.  Thus,  the  LSNR  remained  a small,  isolated  group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  programmatic  roadblocks  were  accompanied  by  problems  of white chauvinism  in  the  Party.  Within  Party  circles,  the LSNR became  an  excuse  for failing to tackle  head-on  the Afro-American  question and white  chauvinism.  Some  even  called  the LSNR the “Negro Party,” This assumed the battle for Black rights could be left to a Black party—rather than being a priority for both whites and Blacks within one party. There wax a tendency to defer</p>

<p class="calibre1">440</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">questions  in the field to the LSNR  and  this became a cover for a white chauvinist underestimation of the Afro-American question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  allowed  many comrades  to  neatly side-step dealing with white chauvinism  and  the  revolutionary  importance  of  the  Black struggle.  In  this sense,  the LSNR  actually became  an obstacle to the  mohilization  of the  entire  Party  for  Afro-American  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  all  these  reasons  the  LSNR  did  not  become  the  mass organization as it was originally conceived. It remained essentially a paper organization, and all our belated attempts to revive it were failures. The LSNR as a national organization ceased to exist. The last  issue  of   <i class="calibre4">The  Liberator</i>  appeared  at  the  end  of  1934.  A  few branches,  those  clearly  associated  with local  issues,  survived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1936,  the  LSNR  was  superseded  by  the  National  Negro Congress,  a  genuine  united  front  organization  of  which  I  will speak  in  later  chapters. </p>
