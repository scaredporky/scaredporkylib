<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trotsky’s  Day  in  Court</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Apart from our academic courses, we received our first tutelage in  Leninism and the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  in the heat of the inner-party struggle then  raging between </p>
<p class="calibre1">•Trotsky and the majority  of the Central Committee led by Stalin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  KUTVA students were not simply bystanders, but were active participants  in the struggle.  Most  of the students—and all  of our group  from  the  U  S.—were  ardent  supporters  of Stalin  and  the Central  Committee  majority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  had  not  always  been  thus.  Otto told  me that  in  1924, a year before he arrived, a majority of the students in the school had been supporters  of Trotsky.  Trotsky  was  making a  play  for the Party youth,  in  opposition  to  the  older  Bolshevik  stalwarts.  With  his usual demagogy, he claimed that the old leadership was betraying the  revolution  and  had  embarked  on  a  course of “Thermidorian reaction </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  this situation,  he said, the students and youth were </p>
<p class="calibre1">“the  Party’s  truest  barometer.*2</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  by  the  time  the  Black  American  students  arrived,  the temporary  attraction  to  Trotsky  had  been  reversed.  The  issues involved in the struggle with Trotsky were discussed in the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They involved the destiny of socialism in the Soviet Union. Which way were the Soviet people to go? What was to be the direction of their  economic  development?  Was  it  possible  to  build a socialist economic system? These questions w'crc not only theoretical ones, but were issues of life and death.  The economic life of the country</p>

<p class="calibre1">would  not  stand  still  and  wait  while  they  were  being debated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Soviet working class, under the leadership of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, had vanquished capitalism over one-sixth of the globe; shattered  its  economic  power;  expropriated  the  capitalists  and landlords; converted the factories, railroads and banks into public property;  and  was  beginning  to  build  a  state-owned  socialist industry.  The  Soviet  government  had  begun  to  apply  Lenin’s cooperative  plans  in  agriculture  and  begun  to  fully  develop  a socialist economic system.  This colossal task had to be undertaken by  the  workers  in alliance  with the  masses of working peasantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  October  Revolution  through  1921,  the  economic system was characterized by War Communism.  Basic industry was nationalized,  and  all  questions  were  subordinated  to  the  one  of meeting  the  military  needs  engendered  by  the  civil  war  and  the intervention  of the capitalist  countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  by  1921,  the  foreign  powers  who  had  attempted  to overthrow  the  Soviets  had  largely  been  driven  from  Russia’s borders.  It  was  then  necessary  to  orient  the  economy  toward  a peace-time  situation.  The  NEP  (New  Economic  Policy)  formulated at the Tenth Party Congress in  1921  was the policy designed to  guide the  transition from  War Communism  to the building of socialism.  It replaced a system of surplus appropriation with a tax in  kind  which  would  be  less  of a  burden  on  the  peasantry.  The NEP  was  a  temporary  retreat  from  socialist  forms:  smaller industries  were  leased  to  private  capital  to  run;  peasants  were allowed  to  sell  their agricultural surplus on free markets; central control  over  much  of the  economy  was  lessened.  All  of this was necessary to  have the economy  function  on  a  peace-time basis.  It was  a measure  designed  to  restore  the  exchange of commodities between  city and  country which  had  been  so greatly disrupted by the civil war and intervention.3 It was a temporary retreat from the attack on all remnants of capitalism, a time for the socialist state to stabilize  its  base  area,  to gather  strength for another advance.  A year  later at the Eleventh Party Congress,  Lenin declared that the retreat  was  ended  and  called  on  the  Party  to  “prepare  for  an offensive  on  private  capital.”  4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lenin was incapacitated by a series of strokes in  1923 and could</p>

<p class="calibre1">no  longer  participate  in the active leadership of the Party.  It was precisely  at  this  time,  taking  advantage  of Lenin's  absence,  that Trotsky  made  his  bid  for  leadership  in  the  Party.  Trotsky  had consistently  opposed  the  NEP  and  its  main  engineer,  Lenin— </p>
<p class="calibre1">attacking  the  measures  designed  to  appease  the  peasantry  and maintain the coalition  between the peasants and the workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  late  1922 on, Trotsky  made a direct attack on the whole Leninist  theory  of  revolution  and  the  dictatorship  of the  proletariat.  He  denied  the  possibility  (and  necessity)  of  building socialism  in one country, and instead characterized that theory as an  abandonment  of  Marxist  principles  and  a  betrayal  of  the revolutionary movement. He postulated his own theory of “permanent  revolution,”  and  contended  that  a  genuine  advance  of socialism in the USSR would become possible only as a result of a socialist  victory  in  the  other  industrially  developed  states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While throwing around  a good  deal  of left-sounding rhetoric, Trotsky's  theories  were  thoroughly  defeatist  and  class-col la ho-rationist.  For  instance,  in  the  postscript  to   <i class="calibre4">Program fo r  Peace,</i> written  in  1922,  he  contended  that  “as  long  as  the  hourgeoisie remains  in  power  in  the  other  European  countries,  we  shall  be compelled, in our struggle against economic isolation, to strive for agreement  with  the  capitalist  world;  at  the  same  time  it  may  be said  with  certainty  that  these agreements  may  at  best  help  us  to mitigate  some  of  our  economic  ills,  to  take  one  or another step forward,  but  real  progress  of a  socialist  economy  in  Russia  will become  possible   <i class="calibre4">only  after  the  victory</i>  of the  proletariat  in the major  European  countries.”5</p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  base  of  this  defeatism  was  Trotsky's  view  that  the peasantry  would  be  hostile  to  socialism,  since  the  proletariat would  “have  to  make  extremely  deep  inroads  not  only  into feudal  but  also into  bourgeois property relations.” Thus Trotksy contended  that  the  working class  would; </p>
<p class="calibre1">...come into  <i class="calibre4">hostile collision</i> not only with all the bourgeois groupings  which  supported  the  proletariat during  the  first stages  of its revolutionary struggle,  but also  <i class="calibre4">with the broad</i> <i class="calibre4">masses  o f the peasantry</i> with  whose assistance it came into power.  The  contradictions  in  the  position  of  a  workers' </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a><img src="index-187_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">TROTSKY’S DAY  IN  COURT</p>
<p class="calibre1">179</p>
<p class="calibre1">government in a backward country with an overwhelmingly peasant population could be solved  <i class="calibre4">only</i> ...in the arena of the world  proletarian revolution.6</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  it  would  not  be  possible  to  build  socialism  in  a backward,  peasant  country  like  Russia.  The  mass  of  peasants would  exhaust  their  revolutionary  potential  even  before  the revolution  had  completed  its  bourgeois  democratic  tasks—the breakup of the feudal  landed  estates and the redistribution of the land  among  the  peasantry.  This  line,  which  underestimated  the role of the peasantry, had been put forward by Trotsky as early as 1915 in his article “The Struggle for Power.” There he claimed that imperialism was causing the revolutionary role of the peasantry to decline  and downgraded the importance of the slogan “Confiscate the  Landed  Estates.”7</p>
<p class="calibre1">As  it  was  pointed  out  in  our  classes,  Trotsky  portrayed  the peasantry  as  an  undifferentiated  mass.  He  made  no  distinction between  the  masses of peasants who worked  their own  land (the <i class="calibre4">muzhiks)</i>  and  the  exploiting strata who hired  labor (the  <i class="calibre4">kulaks). </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  conclusions  openly  contradicted  the  strategy  of the  Bolsheviks, developed  by Lenin, of building the worker-peasant alliance as the  basis  for the dictatorship of the proletariat.8  Further,  they were  at  complete  variance  with  any  realistic  economic  or  social analysis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trotsky’s entire position reflected a lack of faith in the strength and resources of the Soviet people, the vast majority of whom were peasants.  Since  it  denied  the  revolutionary  potential  of  the peasantry,  the  success  of  the  revolution  could  not  come  from internal  forces,  but  had  to  depend  on  the  success of proletarian revolutions  in  the  advanced  nations  of  Western  Europe.  In  the absence  of such revolutions, the revolutionary process within the Soviet  Union  itself  would  have  to  be  held  in  abeyance,  and  the proletariat, which had seized power with the help of the peasantry, would  have to hold state power in conflict4with all other classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind Trotsky’s revolutionary rhetoric was a simplistic social-democratic view which regarded the class struggle for socialism as solely  labor against  capital.  This concept of class struggle did not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a><img src="index-188_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">180</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">regard the struggle of peasant against landlord, or peasant against the  Czar,  as  a constituent  part  of the struggle  for socialism. This was reflected as early as  1905,  in Trotsky’s slogan, “No Czar, but a Workers* Government,** which, as Stalin had said, was “the slogan of revolution  without  the  peasantry” 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given  the  state  of  the  revolutionary  forces  at  the  time,  the position  was  dangerously  defeatist.  For  instance,  1923  marked a period of recession for the revolutionary wave in  Europe; it was a year  of  defeat  for  communist  movements  in  Germany,  Italy, Poland  and  Bulgaria.  What  then,  Stalin  asked,  is  left  for  our revolution?  Shall  it  “vegetate  in  its  own  contradictions  and  rot away while waiting for the world revolution”?,0To that question, Trotsky had no answer.  Stalin’s reply was to build socialism in the Soviet Union. The Soviet working class, allied with the peasantry, had  vanquished  its  own  bourgeoisie  politically  and  was  fully capable of doing the job economically and  building up a socialist </p>
<p class="calibre1">’society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalin’s position did not mean the isolation of the Soviet Unioa The  danger  of  capitalist  restoration  still  existed  and  would exist  until  the  advent  of  classless  society.  The  Soviet  people understood  that  they  could  not  destroy  this  external  danger  by their own efforts, that it could only be finally destroyed as a result of a victorious revolution in at least several of the countries of the West.  The triumph  of socialism in  the Soviet  Union  could  not be final  as long as the external danger existed. Therefore, the success of  the  revolutionary  forces  in  the  capitalist  West  was  a  vital concern  of the  Soviet  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trotsky’s  scheme  of  permanent  revolution  downgraded  not only  the peasantry as  a revolutionary force,  but  also the national liberation  movements  of oppressed peoples within the old Czarist Empire.  Thus,  in  “The  Struggle  for  Power,”  he  wrote  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">“imperialism does  not  contrapose the bourgeois nation to the old regime,  but  the  proletariat  to  the  bourgeois  nation.” 11</p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Trotsky de-emphasized  the national colonial question in the  epoch  of imperialism,  Lenin,  on  the  other  hand,  stressed  its new  importance.  “Imperialism,”  said  Lenin,  means  the  progressively  mounting  oppression  of  the  nations  of  the  world  by  a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a><img src="index-189_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">TROTSKY'S  DAY IN  COURT</p>
<p class="calibre1">181</p>
<p class="calibre1">handful  of Great  Powers;  it  means  a period of wars between the latter to  extend  and  consolidate  the  oppression  of nations."12</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  not until sometime later that  I was able to fully grasp the implications of Trotsky’s concept  of permanent revolution on the international  scene.  The  most  dramatic  example  was  in  Spain during  the  Spanish  Civil  War,  1936-39.  The  Trotskyist  organization  had  infiltrated  the  anarchist  movement  in  Catalonia  and incited revolt against the Loyalist government under the slogans of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Socialist  Republic"  and  “Workers’  Government."  The  Loyalist government,  headed by Juan Negrin,  a  liberal  Republican,  was a coalition  of  all  democratic  parties.  It  included  socialists,  communists, liberal Republicans and anarchists—all in alliance against fascist counter-revolution led by Franco and backed by Hitler and Mussolini.  The attempted coup against  the  Loyalist Government was  typical  of the  Trotskyist  attempts  to  short-circuit  the  bourgeois-democratic  stage  of  the  revolutionary  process.  The  result was  a  “civil  war  within  a  civil  war"  and,  had  their  strategy succeeded,  it  would  have  split  the  democratic  coalition—effectively  giving  aid  to  the  fascists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  United  States  I  was  to  witness  how  Trotsky’s  purist concept  of class struggle led logically to a denial of the struggle for Black  liberation  as  a  special  feature  of  the  class  struggle,  revolutionary in its own right. As a result, American Trotskyists found themselves isolated  from that movement during the great upsurge of the  thirties.  But  all  this was  to  come  later.13</p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the time I  was at  KUTVA, Trotskyism had not yet emerged as  an  important  tendency  on  the  international  scene.  1  did  not foresee  its  future  role  as  a  disruptive  force  on  the  fringes  of the international  revolutionary  movement.  At  that  point,  I  wasn’t clear  myself  on  a  number  of  these  theoretical  questions.  It  was somewhat  later  when  my  understanding  of  the  national  and colonial  question... particularly  the  Afro-American  question—</p>
<p class="calibre1">deepened,  that the implications  of Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution  became  fully  obvious  to  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We students felt that Trotsky’s position denigrated the achievement  of  the  Soviet  Revolution.  We  didn’t  like  his  continual harping  about  Russia’s  backwardness  and  its  inability  to  build</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a><img src="index-190_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">182</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">socialism,  or  his  theory  of  permanent  revolution.  The  Soviet Union  was  an  inspiration  for  all  of us,  a  view  confirmed  by  our experience  in  the  country.  Everything  we  could  see  defied Trotsky’s  logic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  writings  were readily available throughout the school, and the  issues  of  the  struggle  were  constantly  on  the  agenda  in  our collective.  These  were  discussed  in  our  classes,  as  they  were  in factories,  schools  and  peasant  organizations  throughout  the country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  once  a  month  the  collective  would  meet  and  a  report would  be given by Party representatives- -sometimes local, sometimes from the  <i class="calibre4">rayon</i> (region of the city) and Moscow district, and sometimes from the Central Committee itself.  They would  report on the latest developments in the inner-party struggles—Trotsky’s and  Lenin’s views on the question of the peasantry; the NEP, how ij[  had proved its usefulness and how it was now being phased out; Trotsky’s  position  on  War  Communism  and  Party  rules;  the dictatorship of the proletariat, and whether it could be a dictatorship in  alliance   <i class="calibre4">with</i> the peasantry or one   <i class="calibre4">over</i> the peasantry.  An open  discussion  would  be  held  after  the  report.  By that  time the Trotskyists  at  KUTVA  had  dwindled  to  a  small  group  of bitter-enders.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The struggle raged  over a period  of five years (1922-27) during which time the Trotsky bloc had access to the press and Trotsky’s works  were  widely  circulated  for  everyone to  read.  Trotsky  was not  defeated  by  bureaucratic decisions  or  Stalin’s  control  of the Party apparatus —as his partisans and Trotsky ite historians claim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had his day in court  and finally lost because his whole position flew  in  the  face  of Soviet and  world  realities.  He was doomed  to defeat  because  his  views  were  incorrect  and  failed  to conform to objective conditions, as well as the needs and interests of the Soviet people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was  my great misfortune to be out of the dormitory when the Black  students  were  invited  to  attend  a  session  of  the  Seventh Plenum  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  Communist  International, then meeting in the Kremlin in the late fall of 1926.1 was out  in  the  street  at  the  time  and  couldn’t  be found,  so they went</p>

<p class="calibre1">TROTSKY’S  DAY  IN  COURT</p>
<p class="calibre1">183</p>
<p class="calibre1">without me.  I  missed  a  historic occasion,  my only chance to have seen Trotsky in action.  I was bitterly disappointed. When I arrived back at the dormitory, Sakorov, my Indian friend, told me where they had  gone.  Returning in the early  hours  of the morning, they found  me  waiting  for  them.  They  described  the  session  and  the stellar  performance  of Trotsky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalin made the report for the Russian delegation. Trotsky then asked  for two hours to defend  his  position;  he was given one.  He spoke in Russian, and then personally translated and delivered his speech  in German and  then in French.  In all,  he held the floor for about  three  hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  said  it  was  the  greatest  display  of  oratory  he  had  ever heard.  But  despite  this,  Trotsky  and  his  allies  (Zinoviev  and Kamenev) suffered  a resounding defeat,  obtaining only two votes out  of  the  whole  body.  The  delegates  from  outside  the  Soviet Union  didn’t  accept Trotsky’s view  that socialism  in one country was a betrayal of the revolution. On the contrary, the success of the Soviet  Union  in  building  socialism  was  an  inspiration  to  the international  revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  told  me  that  this  point  was  made  again  and  again  in the course of the discussion.  Ercoli (T ogliatti), the young leader of the Italian Party, summed it up well a fewdays later when hedefended the  achievements  of  the  Russian  Party  and  revolution  as  “the strongest  impetus  for the  revolutionary  forces  of the world.”14</p>
<p class="calibre1">The American  Party united  across  factional lines in support of Stalin. The Trotsky opposition, already defeated within the Soviet Union,  was  now  shattered  internationally.  From  there on out,  it was  downhill  for Trotsky.  I  witnessed  Trotsky’s  opposition  bloc degenerate  from  an  unprincipled  faction  within  the  Party  to  a counter-revolutionary conspiracy against the Party and the Soviet state.  We  learned  of  secret,  illegal  meetings  held  in  the  Silver Woods  outside  Moscow,  the  establishment  of factional  printing presses—all  in  violation  of  Party  discipline.  Their  activities reached  a high point during the November 7,  1927  anniversary of the  Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  that  Tenth  Anniversary,  Trotsky’s  followers  attempted  to stage  a  counter-demonstration  in  opposition  to  the  traditional</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a><img src="index-192_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">184</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">celebration.  I  remember vividly the scene of our school contingent marching  on  its  way  to  Red  Square.  As  we  passed  the  Hotel Moscow,  Trotskyist  leaflets  were  showered  down  on  u$,  and orators appeared  at the  windows of the hotel shouting slogans of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Down  with  Stalin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were answered  with catcalls and  booing from the crowds in  the streets below.  We seized  the leaflets and tore them up. This attempt to rally the people against the Party was a total failure and struck no responsive chord among the masses.  It was equivalent to rebellion  and  this  demonstration  was  the  last  overt  act  of  the Trotskyist  opposition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the next  month  Trotsky,  Kamenev and  Zinoviev were expelled —along with seventy-five of their chief supporters.  They, along  with  the  lesser  fry,  were sent  in  exile  to  Siberia in Central Asia.  Trotsky was sent to  Alma Alta in Turkestan from where, in 1£29,  he was allowed to go abroad, first to Turkey and eventually to  Mexico. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,  many  of  Trotsky’s  followers  criticized  themselves  and were  accepted  back  into  the  Party.  But  among them  was a  hard core of bitter-enders,  who "criticized” themselves publicly only in order  to  continue  the  struggle  against  Stalin’s  leadership  from within  the  Party.  Their  bitterness  fed  on  itself and  they emerged later  in the thirties as part of a conspiracy which wound up on the side  of Nazi  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout this whole struggle, we Black students at the school had  been  ardent  supporters  of  the  position  of  Stalin  and  the Central  Committee.  Most  certainly  we  were  Stalinists  -whose policies  we  saw  as  the continuation of Lenin’s.  Those today who use the term "Stalinist” as an epithet evade the real question:  that is, were Stalin and the Central Committee correct? I believe history has  proven  that  they  were  correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RUTHENBERG’S  DEATH</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  March  1927,  the  American  community  in  Moscow  was shocked by the news of the death of Ruthenberg, general sSecrctary</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a><img src="index-193_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">of  the  CPUSA.  His  death  came  suddenly,  from  a  ruptured appendix.  His  last  request  had  been  that  he  be  buried  in  the Kremlin  walls  in  Moscow—a  request  acceded  to  by the  Russian Communist Party.  His ashes  were carried to Moscow by J.  Louis Fngdahl,  a  member  of the Central  Committee of the  U  S.  Party, The  Moscow  funeral  was  impressive.  The  procession entered Red  Square  led  by a detachment  of Red Cavalry. The square was crowded  with  thousands  of Soviet  workers,  including  the entire work force of the  Ruthenberg  Factory,  which had been named in his  honor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We half dozen  Black students, together with other members of the  American  colony,  marched  into  the  square  immediately behind  the urn.  We followed  it  until  we stood directly  in front  of the Lenin Mausoleum.  On top of the mausoleum was the speakers’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">platform.  There  stood  Bukharin,  who  had  recently  succeeded Zinoviev  as  head  of  the  Communist  International:  B61a  Kun, leader  of the abortive  Hungarian  Soviet of  1919;  Sen  Katayama, the  veteran Japanese  Communist;  and  others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bukharin  delivered  the  main  eulogy,  followed  by  several speakers.  Suddenly  I  noticed  Bukharin  whispering  to  Robert Minor,  who  was  standing  beside  him.  Bukharin  pointed  down towards  our  group  of  Blacks  who  were  gathered  below  the mausoleum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Minor  came  down  the  steps  toward  us,  I  was  a  bit apprehensive,  anticipating  his  mission.  Sure  enough,  addressing my  brother  Otto,  he  said,  "Comrade  Bukharin  wants  one of the Negro  comrades  to  say  a few  words." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  pointed  at  me  and  said,  “Let  Harry  speak." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  felt  trapped,  not  wanting  to  start  an  argument  on  such  a solemn  occasion,  I  reluctantly  agreed  to  speak  and  followed Minor back up the steps of the mausoleum.  Bela Kun, a polished orator,  was  speaking;  I  was  to  follow.  I  tried  to  gather  my thoughts,  but  I  was  not  much  of  a  speaker  and  certainly  not prepared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generalities did not come easy to me, and besides, I hadn’t really known  Ruthenberg.  I  had  only  met him formally on the occasion of  my  departure  for  Moscow  when  he  had  sShaken  my  hand and</p>

<p class="calibre1">wished  me  luck.  But  what  could  I  say  about  him,  specifically  in relation  to  the  Blacks? </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  stood  there  amidst  this  array  of  internationally  famous revolutionary  leaders, and as  I  looked down  on  the  thousands of faces in  Red  Square, panic suddenly seized me.  Here was my turn to  speak,  but I found  myself unable to utter a coherent sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 remember saying something about “our great lost leader.” This being my first experience in  front  of a  mike,  the words seemed to come back and hit me in the face. Finally, after a minute or two of floundering around I said, “That’s all!” and turned away from the mike in disgust and humiliation. The words “that’s all” resounded through  the  square  loud  and  clear,  to  my  further  discomfiture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then  came the moment for the translation. The translator was a young Georgian named Tival, one of Stalin’s secretaries.  He was one of those people who speak half a dozen languages fluently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tival  got  right  into  the job  of translation,  assuming an  orator’s stance.  He  had  a strong roaring voice, surprising for one of such diminutive  stature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swinging  his  arms,  apparently  emphasizing  points  that  I  was supposed to have made,  1  must  admit that he made a pretty good speech  for  me.  Speaking two  or  three times  longer  than  my  two minutes  of  rambling,  he  preceded  each  point  by  emphasizing, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Tovarishch  Haywood skazal</i>” (Comrade  Haywood  said). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next  morning,  1  went to the school cafeteria for breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there sat our little group of Black students. Golden had them laughing at  something.  He saw  me  and  waved  the  day’s  copy  of <i class="calibre4">Pravda. </i>  The  headline was   <i class="calibre4">“Pokhorony  Tovarishcha  Ruthenber-ga” </i> (Funeral  of Comrade  Ruthenberg). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden  began  reading  with  a  straight  face,  but  using  that peculiar language of his  -Russian  with a  Mississippi accent. The article  quoted  from  the  main  speeches  and  went  on  to  say, <i class="calibre4">Tovarishch  Harry  Haywood</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Americanski Negr,  tozhe  bystupal</i> (Negro  American comrade Harry Haywood also stepped forward with  a  speech).” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  Golden  read  one  paragraph  after  another  of the  speech Tival  gave  for  me,  each  paragraph  starting  with  44 <i class="calibre4">Tovarishch</i> <i class="calibre4">Haywood  skazal...Tovarishch  Haywood  skazal..Tovarishch</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">187</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Haywood skazal</i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally  Golden  looked  up  from that  paper at  me,  and  he said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Man, you  know you  ain’t skazaled  a goddamned  thing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back  home  in the  U.S.,  the death  of Ruthenberg had signalled another flareup in the factional struggle within the Party.  Following  the  intervention  of  the  Cl  at  the  Fourth  Party  Convention, there was a period of uneasy peace between the factions.  But now a  struggle  for  succession  to  Ruthenberg’s  position  as  general secretary  was  raging  hot  and  heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovestone,  who  had  been  organizational  secretary,  was  supported  by the Ruthenberg stalwarts—Max Bedacht, Ben Gitlow and  John  Pepper.  Since  Ruthenberg’s  death,  Lovestone (as  heir apparent)  had  pre-empted  the  interim job  of acting secretary.  In opposition,  William  W.  Weinstonc was  the candidate supported by  the  Foster-Cannon  bloc  which included  Alexander  Bittelman and  Jack  Johnstone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weinstone  had  formerly  been  a  member  of  the  Ruthenberg faction,  but following Ruthenberg’s death,  he sought the position of general secretary  himself.  His  move offered an opportunity for the  Foster-Cannon  group  to  oppose  Lovestone,  whom  they bitterly  detested,  with  a  candidate  they  believed  had  more  of a chance  of winning than  did  one  of  their  old  stalwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We Blacks in Moscow were isolated from much of this struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  were  sort  of  observers  from  the  sidelines,  and  with  the exception of Otto (who had entered the Party immediately after its founding  convention),  we  didn’t  have  any  of  the  old  factional loyalties  or  political  axes  to  grind.  We  generally  favored  the Ruthenberg leadership, although we could hardly be called ardent supporters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruthenberg’s  leadership  had  been  endorsed  by  the  Cl,  which gave  his  followers  credence  in  our  view.  But  Lovestone  was something else again.  On  this, even Otto agreed.  Lovestone had a reputation  for being a factionalist  par excellence,  involved in the dirty infighting that took place.  He was regarded as a hatchet man for  the  Ruthenberg group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None  of  us  in  Moscow  could  discern  any  principled  political differences  between the two groups  on the question uppermost in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a><img src="index-196_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">188</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">our  minds—the question  of Black  liberation.  Though we had not yet fully succeeded in relating our newly acquired Marxist-Leninist perspective  to  the question of Blacks in  the  U.S.,  we  were sure— </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  our  studies  had  confirmed -  that  Blacks  were  a  potentially powerful  revolutionary force  in the struggle against  U.S.  capital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly  the  common  enemy  could  not  be  defeated  without  a revolutionary alliance of Blacks and the class-conscious elements of the working class.  It was crucial to us that Party policy be directed towards consummating that alliance.  Wc felt,  however, that both factions underestimated the revolutionary potential of Blacks and we  were  determined  not  to  allow  ourselves to  become a political football  between  the  two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There had  been no  progress  in  this area since the folding of the American  Negro  Labor  Congress  in  1925.  The  collapse  of  the ANLC  for  us  confirmed  the  Party's  isolation  from  the  Black masses.  According  to  James  Ford,  a  young  Black  Party  leader, there  were  only  about  fifty  Blacks  in  the  Party  at  this  time.15</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something was definitely wrong.  At the time, we were inclined to attribute the Party’s shortcomings simply to an underestimation of the  importance  of  Afro-American  work.  We were not, at that point,  able  to discern  any theoretical  tendencies within the  Party which served to rationalize this underestimation. Wc felt it was due simply  to  hangovers  of  racial prejudices  of white  Party  members and  leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Moscow, we had been in constant communication with Black comrades in the  U.S.  We had, in fact, set ourselves up as a sort of unofficial  lobby  to  keep  the  situation  with  respect  to  Blacks continuously  before  the  attention  of  the  Russians  and  other Comintern  leaders.  They,  for the most  part, were sympathetic to our  grievances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  May  1927, Jay Lovcstonc (while still acting secretary of the Party)  showed  up  in  Moscow at  the Cl’s Eighth  Plenum.  During his stay, he invited  us Black students to his room at the Lux  Hotel to  give  us an informal report on  the Party’s work among Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had  heard,  of course,  of our discontent and wanted to mollify us.  He  also  knew  that  the  question  was  coming  up  for  serious discussion at the Sixth Congress of the Communist International, </p>

<p class="calibre1">TROTSKY’S  DAY  IN COURT</p>
<p class="calibre1">189</p>
<p class="calibre1">which was to take place the following year. There was no doubt he was  out  to  mend  his  political  fences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  had  my  first  close  look  at  the  man  when  we  gathered  in  his room.  He tried  to give us the impression of being very frank and self-critical.  He  said  the  Party  leadership,  involved  in  factional struggles,  had  neglected  Black  struggles,  had  neglected  Afro-American work, an ’’important phase” of the Party’s activities. But this  factional  phase had  now at  long last come to a close and  the Party (under his leadership) had now hegun seriously to tackle the job  of overcoming this  tremendous  lag  in  the  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He told  us that Otto Huiswood had been placed on the Central Committee and assigned as organizer for the Buffalo (western New York)  district.  We thought it was about time!  Richard  B.  Moore had  been  placed  as New  England  organizer for the International Labor  Defense.  ”1  cite this,”  Lovestone said, “only as an earnest example of the determination oft he Central Committee to remedy our  default  on  this  most  important  question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assuming a modest air,  he turned to me and said, “Last but not least, we have decided that you, Harry, as one of our bright young Negroes, are to be transferred to the Lenin School.  We’ve had our eye  on  you,  Harry,  for some  time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  delighted  at  this  news.  The  Lenin  School  had  been established  only the year before (1926) as a select training school for  the  development  of  leading  cadres  of  the  parties  in  the Communist  International.  But  though  I  was delighted, I was also suspicious  of  the  man;  his  cold  eyes  belied  the  warmth  and modesty  he  tried  to  express.  It  seemed  like  a  bid  to  buy  me out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto,  however,  seemed  to  have  been  impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though Lovestone was a teetotaler, he had a big bottle of vodka in  his  room  for  us  students.  He had  brought  us  presents—which was true of most visitors from the States.  It was understood that a visitor  would  not  return  to  the  U.S.  with  extra  things  that  the students  in  Moscow  could  use.  Most  people,  and  Lovestone was no exception, came prepared with things to give away.  During the course  of  the  evening,  Otto  had  seized  a  few  pair  of socks,  and Lovestone had  given  him a  tin  of pipe tobacco (and cigarettes for us  all).  As  we  were  leaving,  Otto looked  over  Lovestone’s shoes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">190</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say,  Jay,”  he said, “you and  me wear the same size shoes,  don’t we?  You  got  another  pair with  you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure, Otto, sure,” said  Lovestone, and produced an extra pair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On our way home, walking down Tvcrskaya Boulevard towards the  dormitory,  we  exchanged  our  impressions  of  the  evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden started off: “Oh, he’s full of crap. There’s no sincerity in the man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  responded, “I  think you’re wrong. Golden,  I  think you’re wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden  said,  “I  saw  his  eyes.  That’s something you didn’t see, Otto.  You had too much vodka.  You know I’ve always told you to go light on it—-you know you can’t handle the stuff. You remember what  Vesey’s lieutenant said when the slaves rebelled  in  Virginia: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Beware of those wearing the old clothes of the master, for they will betray  you!’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I never saw Otto so furious!  He turned on Golden with his fists clenched,  but thought  better of it.  Golden  was too big.  I laughed, and he turned towards me, but I was his brother. At that moment a drunk  Russian  staggered  into  view  and  suddenly  bumped  into him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto let his fist go and knocked the poor man down. There was a great commotion and a crowd of Russians gathered around. Some Chinese  students  from  our  school  were  across  the  street,  and thinking  wc  were  being  attacked  by  “hooligans,”  rushed  to  our defense.  We  helped  the  man  to  his  feet  and,  in  the  confusion, attempted to explain to the crowd what  had  happened.  Otto said he had  thought the drunk was attacking him, and  it was thus that we  managed  to  pass  the  thing  off and  return  to  our  dorm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovestone  was a  consummate  factionalist,  utterly  uninhibited by  scruples  or  principles.  He  finally  won  out  in  the  struggle  to succeed Ruthenberg, but the mantle of Ruthenberg fit him poorly; the  cloven  hoof was  always  visible.  His  victory was aided by the ineptitude  of  the  Foster-Can non-Weinstone  bloc,  which  made several tactical blunders (of which Lovestone took full advantage), Lovestone’s  friendship with Bukharin was perhaps  a factor in  his victory;  Nikolai  Bukharin  had  succeeded  Zinoviev  as  the  president  of the Comintern.  He  was  an  erstwhile  ally  of Stalin  in the</p>

<p class="calibre1">struggle against the Trotskyist “Left” and was later to emerge as a leader  of  the  right  deviation  within  the  Soviet  Party  and  the Communist  International.  As  head  of the Comintern,  he already had  begun to  line up forces for his next battle which was to break out following the Sixth Congress of the Cl  in 1928.  His man in the U.S.  was  none  other  than  Jay  Lovestone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  have  indicated,  we  KUTVA  students  in  Mosccow  were removed  from  much  of  the  bitterness  of  the  post-Ruthenberg struggle, and at the time, were not fully aware of its intensity. I was to  be  filled  in  with  a  blow-by-blow  account  of what  went  on  at home  by  some  of  my  classmates  at  the  Lenin  School,  which  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">entered  the  following autumn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">VACATION  IN  THE  CRIMEA</p>
<p class="calibre1">The month of August,  vacation time, drew near. Our group of Black students split up and all of us (with the exception of Bankole) left Moscow.  Bankole was reluctant to leave his R ussian girl friend and  remained  in  the  city.  Golden’s  girl  friend,  a  pretty  Kazakhstanian girl, took him home to meet her people in Kazakhstan, an autonomous  republic  in  southwest  Asia,  inhabited  by  aTurko-Mongolian  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for  myself,  1  asked for and received  permission to spend my vacation  in  the  Crimea.  At  the  Chancellor’s  office,  I  was  given money,  a  railroad ticket and  a document entitling me to stay one month at a rest  home in Yalta.  I was  on my own and for the first time  since  my  arrival  fourteen  months  before,  I  was  separated from  my  fellow  Black  students.  But  I  had  no  misgivings.  By  this lime,  1  had acquired a considerable knowledge of the country and had  overcome  the main  hurdles in the language and  could speak and  read  Russian  with some fluency.  In fact, I looked forward to my  journey  with  pleasurable  expectations,  I  was  not  to  be disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Autonomous  Republic  of  Crimea  is  a  square-shaped peninsula jutting out into the Black Sea. At that time, it was one of the two Tartar autonomous republics;  the  other was Tartaria, on</p>

<p class="calibre1">the  Volga.  1  immediately  fell  in  love  with  the  country— its  lush subtropical  climate  and  its  people.  The  Tartars  were  a  dark-skinned  Mongolic  people,  descendants  of the  Golden  Horde  of Genghis  Khan.  When  1 arrived  in Sevastopol, the largest city and seaport,  I  was struck  by the dazzling brilliance  of the sun against the  pastel-colored  buildings,  the  deep  blue  of  the  sea  and  the verdant Crimean  mountains rising behind the city. Tall and stately cypress  trees  lined  the  streets.  It  was  a  busy  seaport;  all types  of shipping could be found in the harbor from small fishing boats to Black Sea passenger liners and ocean-going freighters of the Soviet trading fleet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a history  buff,  I  stopped over for a couple of days to take in the  historic  sites  of the  city  and  its environs.  There was the Pan-arama,  a  life-like  display  graphically  depicting  the  battle  of Sevastopol  during  the  Crimean  War,  1854-66.  (The  war  was fought  mainly  on the Crimean peninsula  between  Russian  forces on the one hand;  British,  French and Turkish allies on the other.) In  this  battle,  the allies  sought  to  knock  out  the strong  Russian naval  base  in  Sevastopol  through  an  invasion  by  land  and bombardment  by  sea.  The  Russians lost the war, but Sevastopol remained  Russian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I drove out to Balaklava, a small village nestling on the sea a few miles southeast of Sevastopol, the sScene of the disastrous charge of the  British  “Light  Brigade,”  led  by  Lord  Cardigan  and  immortalized  by  Tennyson  in  his poem.  Looking at  the  scene  brought back  memories  of childhood  school  days  when  our  class  recited Tennyson’s  poem  aloud.  1  stood  on  Voronsov  Heights  overlooking  the  Valley  of  Death  into  which  rode  the  six  hundred.  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">walked  over the  grounds  and viewed the  graves of the victims of this  blunder  of  the  British  officer  caste.  Fourteen  years  later, Sevastopol  was  to  be  the  site  of one of the most destructive and bloody  battles  of World  War  II. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  automobile  ride  to  Yalta,  about  sixty  kilometers  further along  the  coast,  was  not  only  exciting,  but  in  some  parts,  a frightening experience. It was mostly along a narrow road, cut out of the side  of mountains,  on which two cars could barely pass.  In some  places, one could look down to what appeared to me to be a</p>

<p class="calibre1">sheer drop  of two  or three thousand  feet into the sea  below. The chauffeurs  driving  powerful  Packards,  Cadillacs  and  Espano-Swiss sped along the road with its many curves at breakneck speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  obvious fact  that  they were expert drivers was not enough to allay  my  fears  nor  those  of the  other  passengers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearing Yalta,  we passed Lavadaya, a beautiful palace built by an Italian architect during the reign of Alexander the Third. It was situated  on  a  high  cliff overlooking the  sea.  Later,  it  became the summer home of Czar Nicholas II. Now, under the Soviets, it had been  converted  into  a  rest  home  for  local  peasant  leaders.  The palace  later  housed  President  Roosevelt  and  Premier  Churchill during  the  Yalta  conference  in  1945. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last I  arrived in Yalta, center of the great Crimean resort area which  extended  along  the  coast  and  behind  which  rose  the Crimean Mountains. Yalta was a town of rest homes and sanitaria, mostly owned  by  Soviet trade unions. I was put up at a rest home which  mainly  housed  employees  of  the  Moscow  city  administration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately  after  registering,  I  put on my  bathing trunks and donned the gorgeous Ashanti robe which Bankole had lent me and stepped  out for a dip  in the sea.  I stepped out into the main street which  ran  alongside  the  seashore  and  headed  for  the  beach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  many  of  the  Tartars  of  the  area  were  dark-skinned, Blacks  were  rarely  seen, even  in  these  southern  climes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  1  passed  along  I  could  hear  remarks  like,  <i class="calibre4">“Kak  khorosho</i> <i class="calibre4">zagorehya</i> (How  beautifully  sunburnt  he  is)l”  It  was  a  remark I was to hear often.  It was good  natured, and 1 sensed in it a trace of envy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowds were  mainly vacationers from  the north, who after the long,  weary and cold sub-arctic winters of central  Russia had fled to this semi-tropical paradise to soak up a little sunshine.  Here they formed  a cult of sun-worshippers bent on acquiring a suntan to  display  upon  their  return  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A crowd of small boys followed me out to the public beach a few blocks  away.  Perhaps they associated  me with some  of the South Sea  Island  characters  they  had  seen  in  movies  and  waited expectantly  for  an  exhibition  of my  aquatic  skills.  I  doffed  my</p>

<p class="calibre1">gorgeous  robe  and  stepped  into  the  water,  walked  out  a  few  feet and  sat  down.  I  turned  to  see  expressions  of  amazement, disappointment,  and  even  pity.  Their  bewilderment  was  quite natural,  for  I  myself had  never  met  a  Russian  who  didn’t  know how  to  swim.  These children  regarded  swimming to  be a  natural human  attribute;  to  them,  an  adult  who  couldn’t  swim  was regarded  as  sort  of a  cripple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One day, while walking to the beach in Yalta, 1 was approached by  a  uniformed  officer of  the  OGPU  (federal  police).  <i class="calibre4">“Bonjour,</i> <i class="calibre4">camarade, vous ites Sinigalais?” </i> ho asked in French. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He seemed a  bit surprised when I responded in  Russian, telling him  that  I  was  an  American  Black  and  a  student  at  KUTVA  in Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said that  he  had  noticed  me several times on the streets and wondered  if I  were Senegalese.  He had fought  beside Senegalese riflemen  during  the  world  war.  His  Cossack  regiment,  he  explained,  was  a  part of a small Russian expeditionary force sent to fight  with  the  French  Army  on  the  Western  Front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  told  him  that I had also fought  in the war with an  American Black  regiment  and  how  I  had  seen  Russian  troops  in a  prison camp on my way to the Soissons front in the late summer of 1918.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked  him  if he  had  been  in  that  camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He shrugged and said that it was quite possible. "They scattered us around in a number of camps; they didn’t want too many of us together  in  one  place,”  he  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our  Russian  force,”  he  went  on,  "was  small  and  had  no real military  significance.”  It  had  been  sent  by  the  Czar  as  a demonstration of solidarity and friendship between Russia and France— </p>
<p class="calibre1">sort  of a  morale  booster  for the  French  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Be that as it may,” he said, "it didn’t boost our morale any to be there.  In  France,  we fought in some of the toughest  battles in the war,  on  the  Champagne  front  and  the  Marne  salient,  and  we suffered  heavy  casualties.  Our  fellows  were  homesick  and  confused,  and  didn’t  know  what  they  were  fighting  for so  far away from  Mother  Russia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There  was  much  grumbling  and  always  an  undercurrent of discontent.  All of this was heightened towards the latter part of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">war by the bad news of Russian defeats on the Eastern Front. This all came to a head with the news of the fall of the Czar. Shortly after that  we  were  withdrawn  from  the  front  by  the  French,  as  an unreliable  element.  Behind  the  lines,  we  were  surrounded  and disarmed  by Senegalese troops, and quite a number who  resisted were  killed  or wounded.  To  say that  we were 'unreliable'  was  an understatement;  by that  time,  we  were downright  mutinous!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Bolshevik  Party  had  active  nuclei  in  the  regiments.  "I myself was  a  member  of  the  Party,”  said  my  new-found  friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We  followed  the  course  of  the  Revolution  through  French newspapers  and  were  able  to  glean  the  truth  behind  their distortions.  We  also  had  contact  with  some  of  the  French  left-socialists  and  with  Bolshevik  exiles  before  they  returned  home after the outbreak of the February Revolution. After the Armistice was signed,  wc were sent  to  Morocco and eventually Soviet ships came  to  take  us  to  Odessa  and  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  French  used  the  Senegalese  against  us,”  he  said.  "We learned  later  of a  mutiny  among  the  Senegalese  troops  in which they were shot up and disarmed by the French Blue Devils.” I  had just  been  reading Andr6 Barbusse and was surprised to learn how widespread  mutiny  had  been  in  the  French  Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, e'est la guerre,” he said, "especially so an imperialist war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  all,  what  interest  had  the  Senegalese  in  defending  French imperialism? What  interest did we Russian workers and  <i class="calibre4">muzhiks</i> (peasants)  have  in  fighting  the  Czar's  wars?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We parted, with  both of us wanting to meet again, but he had to leave  town  that  evening  and  I  never saw  him  again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Often, we visited the local vineyards and wine cellars and tasted the local wines.  It was wine country and Crimean wines were of the first quality, from  the sweet ports, tokays and muscatels, to the dry red and  white wines.  On  these outings there was always someone who  had  a  guitar  or accordion,  and  we  sat  late  into  the  nights singing  Russian  folk  songs  and  gypsy  romans  (love  songs). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Crimea was not just a vacationers’ haven, although tourism occupied a  large place in its economy.  At that  time, the economy was  mainly agricultural.  Vineyards  were constantly expanding in the  mountain  valleys  along  the  southern  coast.  Tobacco  of fine</p>

<p class="calibre1">quality  was  grown,  and  there  was  also  an  important  fishing industry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the east coast of the peninsula near Kerch, there was an area of rich  iron  ore deposits and mines.  This  was to serve as the basis for the construction  of the gigantic Kerch metallurgical, chemical and  engineering works,  contemplated in the first five year plan.  It was  a  plan  which  sought  to  quadruple  the  hasic  capital  of  the republic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  renaissance  of national  cultures  which  accompanied the  Soviet  policy  on  the  national  question,  the Turkic  language spoken by the Tartars—which  I  understood was closely related to modern  Turkish —was  being  revived  and  taught  in  schools.  A Latinized  alphahet  was  introduced,  replacing  the  old  Arabic script.  Tartar  literature  and  culture  flourished  through  this encouragement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*  1  met  the  Party  secretary  for  the county,  a  young Tartar  who took me to visit a  <i class="calibre4">kolkhoz</i> (collective farm), a vineyard in this case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hundred or more peasant families were in the collective, all winegrowers.  As  in  all  collective  farms,  its  members were required  to sell a definite amount to  the government at fixed  prices and were allowed  to  sell  the  surplus  on  the  free  markets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each family had a special plot of land which they cultivated for their own food supply*  The chairman  of the collective was a huge Ukrainian fellow, who showed us around and explained the winegrowing process. The cultivation of grapes and making of the wine required  special  knowledge,  which  the  government  supplied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  members of the collective used  up-to-date wineries owned by the state and  managed  by expert  vintners.  There I was to view the  intricate  process  of wine-making,  the  pressing  of the  grapes, the fermenting process and the bottling itself.  As I  remember, this particular collective specialized in dry wines—both red and white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Crimeans insisted that their wines were as good as the French. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  being a connoisseur, I wouldn't know, but all I can say is that they  tasted  good  to  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  I  returned  to  Moscow  in  the  fall,  Otto  told  me  of the discovery he had made on one of his trips to the southern region of the Caucasus.  He had originally gone there on the invitation of one</p>

<p class="calibre1">of our  fellow  students,  a  young  woman  from  the  Abkhazian Republic,  a  part  of  Georgia.  After  meeting  some  of  us,  she commented that they too had some Black folk down near her area in a  village not very far from Sukhum,  the capital  of the republic on  the  Black  Sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  invited  Otto  down  to  visit  the  region  over  his  summer vacation, and there he met the people.  He described them as being iif  definite  black  ancestry—notwithstanding  a  history  of  intermarriage  with  the  local  people.  But  the  <i class="calibre4">starsata</i> (old  man)  of the tribe was  Black beyond a doubt.  His story went some generations hack,  when  he  and  the  others  joined  the  Turkish  army  as Numidian  mercenaries  from  the Sudan.  After several forays  into this  region  they  deserted  the  Army  and  had  settled  there.  The <i class="calibre4">starsata</i>  himself  had  been  in  the  Czar’s  Cavalry  with  the   <i class="calibre4">Dikhi</i> (wild)  Division  of the  Caucasus  Cossacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people in the village wanted to know what was happening to </p>
<p class="calibre1">“our  brothers  over  the  mountains.”  Otto  related  to  them  the I roubles  we  had  gone  through,  described  the  travels  “over  the mountains and across the hig sea.” As the evening wore on and the local  hrandy  was  consumed,  toast  after toast  was  drunk  to uour little  brother  from  over  the  hills.”  Otto  descrihed  to  them  the conditions  of  Blacks  in  the  U.S.  the  lynchings,  racism  and brutality.  Incensed, a few jumped up and pulled out their daggers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  should  make  a  revolution.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why  don’t you  revolt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why do  you  put  up  with  it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wc were not the only ones surprised to learn about this group; it was  news  to  the  Russians  in  Moscow  too!  Several  of  these tribesmen  later  visited  Moscow  as  a  result  of Otto’s  visit. </p>
