<p class="calibre1">Chapter  5</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A  Student  in  Moscow</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto’s delegation of Black students to  the Soviet Union caused quite a  stir  in  the  States.  The  FBI  kept  an  eye on their activities and,  in  late  summer  1925,  their departure was sensationalized  in the   <i class="calibre4">New  York  Times</i>.1 The article attributed a statement to Lovett Fort-Whiteman  to  the  effect  that  he  had  sent  ten  Blacks  to the Soviet  Union  to  study  bolshevism  and  prepare for careers in the communist  “diplomatic  service.”  The  article  concluded  with  a statement  calling for action  against  such “subversive  activity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  time,  we  all  felt  that any Black applying for a  passport would  be  subjected  to  close scrutiny.  Therefore,  when  I  learned that  I  too  would  soon  be  studying  in  Moscow,  I  applied  for  a first  names of my  Mother (Harriet) and  Father (Haywood).  This name  was  to  stick  with  me the  rest  of my  life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several weeks after 1 received my passport, I heard the FBI had been  making  inquiries  about  me.  By  that  time,  I  had  become known as one of the founders of the ANLC. Therefore, as the time for my departure drew near, I hid out at the home of comrades on Chicago’s  Westside  until  arrangements  were made.  I  went  to the national  office of the Communist Party,  then in Chicago, and was informed  by Ruthenberg or Lovestone that  I  should get ready to leave, Political credentials, typed on silk, were sewn into the lining of my coat sleeve. In order to avoid going through the port of New York,  I  left  by  way  of Canada. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a><img src="index-157_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">149</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the  manner of the old  Underground  Railroad,  1 was passed on from one set of comrades to the next: from Detroit, Rudy Baker, the  district  organizer,  forwarded  me  on  to  the  Canadian  Party headquarters  in  Toronto  where Jim  MacDonald  and  Tim  Buck were  in  charge.  They  sent  me  on  to  Montreal  where  comrades housed  me  and  booked  passage  for  me to  Hamburg,  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boarding ship  in Quebec in the late spring of 1926,1 sailed on the Canadian  Pacific  liner,  the  old   <i class="calibre4">Empress  o f  Scotland</i>  From Hamburg,  I  took  a  train  to  Berlin,  arriving  on  a  Saturday afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had the address of Hazel Harrison  the wife of a Chicago friend of mine  who  was  a  concert  pianist  studying  in  Berlin, where she had  had her professional debut. (Years later, she was to head the Music Department  at  Howard  University.) At that  time, she was living at a boarding house near the Kurfiirstendamm and I stopped there  for  the remainder  of the  weekend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the first time  I  had  been  in Berlin. Germany was then emerging  from  post-war  crisis,  during  which  currency  inflation had  reached  astronomical  heights,  resulting  in  the  virtual  expropriation of a large section  of the middle class. It was common to see shabbily dressed  men still trying to keep up appearances by wearing  starched  white collars  under their  patched  clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  owners  of  the  boarding  house,  two  middle-aged  widows who were friends of Hazel's,  showed  me a trunk filled  with paper notes—old  German  marks  which  were now  worthless.  This  had probably  represented  a  life's  savings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hazel  and  her two friends took me out to  the Tiergarten—the famous  Berlin Zoo.  1  was attracted  by the sight of three lion cubs that  had  been  mothered  by a German  police dog. The cubs were getting big, and it was clear that the “mother" was no longer able to control  them.  We  watched  for  some  time,  fascinated.  I  turned around  and  realized  that  there was a crowd  around us.  At first  I thought they were looking at the cubs, but then it became clear that Hazel and I were the center of attention. Blacks were rare in Berlin in those days—there were only half a dozen or so,  mostly from the former German  colonies  of the  Cameroons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monday  morning  I  took  a  cab  to  the  headquarters  of  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">150</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">German  Party,  at  Karl  Marx  House  on  Rosenthallerstrasse.  It was a dour, fortress-like structure, with high walls surrounding the main  building  which  was  set  in  the  middle.  I  entered  into  the anteroom just  inside  the walls,  in  which  there  were  a  number of sturdy looking young men lounging around.  When I came in, they jumped  up  and  stood  eyeing me  suspicously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  unarmed,  but  I  knew  their  weapons  were  within arms’ reach. This was a symbol of the times for it was not longafter the  Beer  Hall  Putsch  of  Hitler’s  brownshirts  in  Munich, and the battle  for the  streets of Berlin  had already  begun.  I  presented  my credentials  to  a  man  named  Walters,  who  was  undoubtedly the head  of security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  on  this  occasion  that  I  first  met  Ernst  Thaelmann,  a former  Hamburg  longshoreman  and  then  leader of the  German Communist  Party.  He was passing through the gate and Walters stopped  him  and  introduced  us.  Thaelmann  spoke  fairly  good English  (probably  acquired  in  his  work  as  a  seaman)  and  we chatted  a  while.  He  asked  after  Foster,  Ruthenberg and  others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wishing  me  good  luck,  he  passed  on  his  way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walters gave  me some spending money and arranged for me to stay  with  some  German  comrades,  a  young  couple  who  had  an elaborate  apartment.  The  husband  ran  a  haberdashery  store  on Friedrichstrasse and  was a commander in the  <i class="calibre4">Rote Front</i> (the red front)  the para-military organization which the communists had organized  for defense  of workers  against  the  fascists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  day  while  walking  down  the  Kurfurstendamm,  I  saw  a cabaret  billboard  advertising  the  Black jazz  band  of Leland  and Drayton and  their Charleston  dancers.  It was a well-known band back  in  the  States.  I  had  little  money,  but  I  couldn’t  resist  the temptation  to  stop  in  and  hear  them.  I  sat  down  at a  table  and ordered a beer.  To my dismay, the waiter said they didn’t sell beer, just wine.  So I  took the  wine card  and  chose the cheapest bottle I could  find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A number of band  members and dancers came over to my table and  asked  where  1  was  going.  When  I  told  them  I  was a student going  to  Moscow,  they  said  they  had  just  returned  from  a six-month tour in Russia. They were the first Black jazz group that</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">151</p>
<p class="calibre1">h;id gone to the Soviet Union.  I asked if they had met Otto and the other  Black students  there.  Yes,  they  had  met  them  all  and  they had had good times together. So we all sat down to exchange news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we talked, 1 began to worry about the bill, and said 1 was low on  money.  “Oh,  don’t  worry  about  that,”  someone  said  and ordered  more wine.  But when it came time to pay for the drinks, I got  stuck with  the whole  tab and  had to walk several miles across lown  to  get  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a month in Berlin, my visa came through. I was on my way to  Stettin,  a  city  on  the  Baltic  Sea  which  bordered  Poland  and where  I  boarded  a small Soviet ship.  After three  days of some of t he roughest seas I  have ever experienced, we landed in Leningrad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was April  1926, and we were already in the season of the “white nights,”  when  daylight  lasted  until  late  into  the  evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  we  entered  the  Gulf of Finland  the  following morning, we passed the naval fortress of Kronstadt about twenty miles out from Leningrad  (the site  of the  anti-Soviet  mutiny  of  1920).  The  ship finally  docked  in  Leningrad.  Upon landing,  I  presented  my  visa and  passport  to the  authorities.  Addressing me in  English, a man in civilian dress said, “Oh. you’re going to the Comintern school in Moscow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”  I  replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He immediately took me in charge and got my baggage through customs.  I assumed  he was a member of the security police. We left the  customs huilding and  got  into an  old  beat-up Packard.  As we drove away from the docks, he informed me that the Moscow train would  not  leave until eight that evening.  He put  me up at  a hotel where  I  could  rest  and  go  out  to  see  the  city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leningrad  (old  St.  Petersburg)  was  built  by  Czar  Peter  the Great  in  the sixteenth  century and  now renamed  for the architect of the  new  socialist  society.  As  I  walked  down  the  now  famous Nevsky Prospckt, I thought of John Reed’s   <i class="calibre4">Ten Days That Shook</i> <i class="calibre4">the  World, </i> trying to recapture some of the dramatic scenes in that classic.2 I  passed the Peter and Paul Fortress and then  the Winter Palace-  once  the  home  of the  czars  and  now  a  museum  of the people.  The  storming of the  Winter  Palace  in  1917  had been  the crucial  event  in  the  taking of St.  Petersburg  by  the  Bolsheviks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a><img src="index-160_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">152</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">The people 1  saw passing me on the street were plainly dressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  of the  men  wore  the traditional   <i class="calibre4">robochka</i> and  high boots; others  were in  European dress.  Most  people were dressed  neatly, though shabhily, and all appeared to be well-fed. They were bright and  cheerful.  It seemed  they went  ahout  with a purpose—a sharp contrast  to  the  atmosphere  of  hopelessness  that  had  pervaded Berlin.  People in  Leningrad  looked  at me-..and  I looked at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  this  time,  I  had  become used  to  being stared  at and took  it as friendly curiosity.  After all, a Black man was seldom seen in those parts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After several  hours,  I  returned to my hotel.  My friend from the security police showed up promptly at  seven with  my train  ticket and took me to the station to put me on the train to Moscow.  Filled with excitement and anticipation, I got little sleep on the train and awoke early to seethe Russian landscape flowing by my window— </p>
<p class="calibre1">pine forests, groves of birch trees and swamps. 1 was in the midst of the great  Russian  steppes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  we  arrived  in  Moscow  at  Yaroslavsky  Station, some of my traveling companions hailed  a  <i class="calibre4">droshky</i> and  told  the driver to take  me  to  the  Comintern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moscow  at  last!  We  drove  from  the  station  into  the  vast sprawling city—once the capital of old Russia and now of the new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a bright, sunny morning and the sun glistened off the golden church  domes  in  the  “city  of a  thousand  churches."  It  seemed  a maze  of narrow,  cobblestone streets, intersected  by broad  boulevards.  While  Leningrad  had  been  a  distinctly  European  city, Moscow  seemed  a  mixture  of the  Asiatic and  the  European—a bizarre  and  strange  combination  to  me,  but  a  cheerful  one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moscow  was  more  Russian  than  the  cosmopolitan  Leningrad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crowds  swarmed  in  the  streets  in  many  different  styles  of dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  arrived  at  the  Comintern,  which  was  housed  in  an  old eighteenth century  structure on Ulitsa Komintem near the Kremlin, across the square from Staraya Konyushnya (the old stables of the czar).  1  paid  the driver and  entered the building. The guard at the  door  checked  my  credentials  and  directed  me  upstairs  to  a small  office  on  the  third  floor.  After  producing  my  bonafides,  I was told to take a seat, to wait for my comrades who would soon be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a><img src="index-161_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">153</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming  for  me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About half an  hour later,  Otto and another Black man entered the  room.  I  was overjoyed  at the sight of him and his friend, who turned  out to be a fellow student, Harold Williams.  We embraced Russian  style,  and  I  began  to  feel  more  at  home  in  this  strange land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto asked  about the family.  An expression of sadness crossed his  face,  however,  when  I  asked  him  about  the  rest  of the Black students,  He  then  informed  me of Jane  Golden's  serious  illness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was at that  moment  in a uremic coma from a kidney ailment and  was not  expected to live.  Her husband  was at  her side at the hospital.  (Though  both  were  from  Chicago,  1  had  not  met them before.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The situation had  saddened  the whole Black student body, and for  that  matter,  the  whole  school.  In  the  course  of  her  brief sojourn,  Jane  had  become  very  popular.  Otto  described  her  in glowing terms—a real morale  booster, whose spirit had  helped all of them  through  the  period  of initial  adjustment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was impressed.  Here was a Black woman, not a member of the Communist  Party,  who  had  so easily  become  accustomed  to the new  Soviet  socialist society.  It  seemed  to  me  that  there  must  be thousands  of  Black  women  like  her in  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  we  had  greeted  each other,  we caught a  <i class="calibre4">droshky</i> over to the  school  in order that 1 might register officially . In the course of the ride, the driver lashed his horse and cursed at him. I asked Otto what  he  was  saying,  and  he  gave a  running translation:  “Get up there, you son-of-a-bitch.  1  feed you oats while 1 myself eat black bread!  Your sire was no good,  you bastard, your momma was no good  too!”  This  verbal  and  physical  abuse,  Otto  told  me,  was typical  of most  Russian   <i class="calibre4">droshky</i> drivers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  finally  arrived  at  the  school  administration  which  was housed  in another old  seventeenth century structure,  built before the  Revolution. It had been a finishing school for daughters of the aristocracy-  Before that,  it  had  been a hoys’ school where,  rumor has  it,  the  great  Pushkin  had  studied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto introduced  me to the university rector with what sounded to my untrained ear like fluent Russian.  We then went to the office</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a><img src="index-162_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">154</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the chancellor, where I was duly registered.  I was now a student at  the   <i class="calibre4">Universitet  Trydyashchiysya  Vostoka  Jmeni  Stalina</i>  (the University of the Toilers of the  East Named for Stalin)--Russian acronym  KUTVA.  Otto and I then walked to the dormitory a few blocks away  where  I  met  the  other two  Black  students,  Bankole and  Farmer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  all  immediately  took a  streetcar to  the hospital which was located on the other side of the Moscow  River. There we were met by  Golden  and  some  other  students  who  informed  us  that  Jane Golden  had just passed  away that morning.  Golden seemed to be in  a state of shock and the doctors had given him some sedatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We went into the hospital morgue to view her body. Bankole broke down  in  uncontrollable tears.  I  learned  afterwards that Jane had been a close friend—a kind of mother to him during the period of his  adjustment  to  this  new  land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JVe took Golden  home to the dormitory.  The school collective and  its  leaders  immediately  took  over the  funeral arrangements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  body  lay  in  state  in  the  school  auditorium  for  twenty-four hours,  during  which  time  the  students  thronged  past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  funeral  was  held  the following day  and  the  whole school turned  out.  The  cortege  seemed  a  mile  long  as  it  flowed  past Tverskaya towards the cemetery. The students would not allow the casket  to  be  placed  upon  the  cart,  but  organizing themselves  in relays  every  fifty  yards,  insisted  on  carrying  it  the  distance  of several  miles  on  their shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  good  portion  of  the  American  colony  in  Moscow  was assembled at the cemetery. The chairman of the school collective, a young Georgian, delivered a stirring eulogy at the graveside. One of  the  students  who  was  standing  next  to  me  made  a  running translation   <i class="calibre4">sotto  voce</i>  which  went  something like  this; The first among her race to come to the land of socialism...in search of freedom for her oppressed peoples, former slaves... </p>
<p class="calibre1">to find  out  how  the  Soviets  had done it.  We were happy to receive her and  her comrades...condolences to her bereaved husband, our Comrade Golden, and to the rest of the Negro students...the whole university has suffered a great loss.  Rest in peace, Jane Golden. You were with us only a short time, but all of us have benefitted from your presence and comradeship. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a><img src="index-163_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">155</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning to  Golden,  he said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We  Soviet  people  and  comrades of oppressed colonial  and dependent countries  must carry on.  We pledge our undying support to the cause of your people’s freedom.  Long live the freedom fight of our Negro brothers in America! Long live the Soviet Union and  its  Communist  Party, beacon light of the struggle for freedom of all oppressed peoples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden  had  borne  himself well  at  the graveside,  but  we didn't want him to  return to  his  room  in the students’ dormitory, which would  only  remind  him  of  his  grievous  loss.  So  we  went  to  the apartment  of  MacCloud,  an  old  Wobbly  friend  of  ours  from Philadelphia,  who  had attended  the funeral and  who  lived  in  the Zarcchnaya  District,  across the river.  He was a close friend of Big Bill  Haywood  and had followed the great working class leader to the Soviet Union.  There we tried to drown our sorrows in good old Russian  vodka,  which  was  in  plentiful  supply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jane Golden’s funeral and the school collective’s response to her death  made a profound  impression  on  me.  Through these events, crammed into the first three days of my stay in the Soviet Union, I came  to  know  something  about  my  fellow  students  and  the new socialist  society  into  which  I  had  entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  BOLSHEVIKS  FIGHT FOR  EQUALITY OF NATIONS</p>
<p class="calibre1">KUTVA  was  a  unique  university.  At  the  time  I  entered,  its student  body  represented  more  than  seventy  nationalities  and ethnic  groups.  It  was  founded  by  the  Bolsheviks  for  the  special purpose  of  training  cadre  from  the  many  national  and  ethnic groups  within  the  Soviet  Union—the  former colonial dependencies of the czarist empire—and  also to train cadres from colonies and  subject  nations  outside  the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The school  was divided into  two sections  -inner and outer.  At the  inner section there were Turkmenians,  Uzbeks, Tajiks,  Bashkirs,  Yakuts,  Chuvashes,  Kazaks,  Kalmucks,  Buryat-Mongols and  Inner  and  Outer  Mongolians  from  Soviet  Asia.  From  the Caucasus  there  were  Azerbaidzhanis,  Armenians,  Georgians, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a><img src="index-164_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">156</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Abkhazians  and  many  other  national  and  ethnic  groups  I  had never heard of before. There were Tartars from the Crimea and the Volga  region. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The national and ethnic diversity found within the Soviet Union is hard to imagine. The Revolution had opened up many areas, for example  through  the  Trans-Caucasus  Road, and  as late as  1928, the  existence  of  new  groups  was  still  being “discovered.”  These nationalities  were  all  former  colonial  dependencies  of the  czars and  were  referred  to  as  the “Soviet  East,” “peoples of the East,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and “borderland countries.” The inner section comprised the main and  largest  part  of the  student  body  in  the  university. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We Blacks were of course part of the outer section at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  included  Indians,  Indonesians,  Koreans,  Filipinos,  Persians, Egyptians,  Arabs  and  Palestinian  Jews  from  the  Middle  East, Arabs  from  North  Africa,  Algerians,  Moroccans,  Chinese  and several Japanese (hardly a colonial  people, but as revolutionaries, identified  with  the  East). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Chinese,  several  hundred  strong,  comprised  the  largest group  of  the  outer  section.  This  was  obviously  because  China, bordering  on  the  USSR,  was  in  the  first  stage  of  its  own  antiimperialist  revolution,  a  revolution  receiving direct  material and political  support  from  the  Soviet  Union.  While KUTVA trained the communist cadres from China, there was also the Sun Yat-sen University, just  outside  of Moscow, which trained cadres for the Kuomintang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  its  students  was  the  daughter  of the  famous Christian general,  Chang  Tso-lin.  Several  Chinese,  including Chiang  Kai-shek’s son, studied in Soviet military schools during this period.  A number of the Chinese students from KUTVA were massacred by Chiang’s troops at the  Manchurian  border when they returned to China  shortly after Chiang’s  bloody  betrayal of the revolution  in 1927.  Otto told  me that a former girlfriend  of his was among this group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  I  remember,  there  were  no  Latin  Americans  at  KUTVA during  the  time  I  was  there,  and  the  sole  black  African  was Bankole. The student  body was continually expanding, however, and  later  included  many  students  from  these  and  other  areas. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a><img src="index-165_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT  IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">157</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wc students  studied  the  classic  works  of Marx,  Engels,  Lenin and Stalin. But unlike the past schooling we had known, this whole body of theory was related to practice. Theory was not regarded as dogma,  but  as  a  guide  to  action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  May  1925,  Stalin  had  delivered  an  historic  speech  at  the school, outlining KUTVA’s purpose and its main task. His lecture was  the  subject  of continuous  discussion  and  study.3  It  was  our introduction to the Marxist theory on the national question and its development  by  Lenin  and  Stalin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  did  the  Bolsheviks  transform  a  territory  embracing one-sixth  of  the  earth’s  surface—known  as  the  “prison-house  of nations” under the Czar—into a family of nations, a free union of peoples?  What  was  the  policy  pursued  by  the  Soviets  which enabled  them  to  forge  together  more  than  a  hundred  different stages  of  social  development  into  such  extraordinary  unity  of effort  for the building of a multinational  socialist state—the kind of unity that enabled them to win the civil war within and to defeat the intervention of seventeen nations, including the United States, from  without. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The starting point for us was to  understand that the formation of peoples  into  nations is an objective law of social development around  which the  Bolsheviks,  particularly Lenin and  Stalin,  had developed  a  whole  body  of  theory.  According  to  this  theory,  a nation  is  an  historically  constituted  stable community of people, based  on  four  main  characteristics:  a  common  territory,  a common  economic  life,  a  common  language  and  a  common psychological makeup (national character) manifested in common features in a  national  culture.  Since  the development of imperialism, the liberation of the oppressed nations has become a question whose  final  resolution  would  only  come  through  proletarian revolution.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  guiding  principle  of the  Communist  Party  of the  Soviet Union on the national question was to bring about the unity of the laboring  masses  of  the  various  nationalities  for  the  purpose  of waging a joint struggle—first to overthrow czarism and imperialism,  and  then  to  build  the  new  society  under  a  working  class dictatorship.  The  accomplishment  of  the  latter  required  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">establishment of equality before the law for all nationalities —with no  special  privileges  for  any  one  people  -and  the  right  of  the colonies  and  subject  nations  to  separate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  principle was  incorporated  into  the law of the land  in the Declaration  of Rights of the People of Russia,  passed a few days after  the  seizure  of  power  by  the  Bolsheviks.  Of  course,  the declaration of itself did not eliminate national inequality, which as Stalin  had  observed, “rested  on  economic inequality,  historically formed.”  To  eliminate  this  historically  based  economic  and cultural inequality imposed by theczarist regimes upon the former oppressed nations, it was required that the more developed nations assist  these  formerly  oppressed  nations  and  peoples  to  catch  up with  the  Great  Russians  in  economic  and  cultural  development. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In pursuance of this aim, the new government was organized on a bicameral basis. One body was chosen on the basis of population alone;  the  other,  the  Council  of  Nationalities,  consisted  of representatives  from  each  of  the  national  territorial  units... the autonomous  Soviet  republics,  autonomous  regions and  national areas.  Any  policy  in  regard  to  the  affairs  of  these  formerly oppressed nations could be carried through only with the approval of the Council of Nationalities. The Communist Party, through its members,  was involved in both  bodies and worked to see that its policy  of  full  equality  and  the  right  of  self-determination  was implemented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  this  theory  was  put  into  practice,  we  learned  that  national cultures  could  be  expressed  with a proletarian (socialist) content and that there was no antagonistic contradiction, under socialism, between  national  cultures  and  proletarian  internationalism.  Under the Soviets, the languages and other national characteristics of the many nationalities were developed and strengthened with the aim  of  drawing  the  formerly  oppressed  nationalities  into  full participation  in  the new society.  Thus, the Bolsheviks upheld the principle  of “proletarian  in  content,  national in form.” Through this policy, they hoped to draw all nationalities together, acquainting  each  with  the  achievements  of the  others,  leading to  a  truly universal  culture,  a joint  product  of all  humanity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  in  sharp  contrast  to  imperialism’s  policy  of  forcibly</p>

<p class="calibre1">arresting and distortingthe free development of nations in order to maintain their economic and cultural backwardness as an essential condition  for  the extraction  of superprofits.  Thus, the oppressed nations  can  achieve  liberation  only  through  the  path  of revolutionary struggle to overthrow imperialism and in alliance with the working  class  of the  oppressor  nations.  Stalin,  proceeding from the  experience  and  practice  of the Soviet  Union,  emphasized the need for the formation and consolidation of a united revolutionary front  between  the  working  class  of  the  West  and  the  rising revolutionary movements of the colonies -  a united front based on a  struggle  against  a  common  enemy.  The  precondition  for forming such unity  is that the proletariat of the oppressor nations gives:</p>
<p class="calibre1">direct and determined support to the liberation movement of the  oppressed  peoples  against  the  imperialism  of its  “own country,”  for  “no  nation  can  be  free  if  it  oppresses  other nations.”  (Engels)....This support  implies  the  advocacy, defense and implementat ion of the slogan of the right of nations to secession,  to  independent existence as states.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">Without  this  cooperation  of  peoples  based  on  mutual  confidence and fraternal interrelations, it will be impossible to establish the  material  basis  for the  victory  of socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  test  of all  this  theory  was  being proven  in  practice  in the Soviet  Union.  The  experience  of  the  Bolsheviks  demonstrably proved to us  that  socialism  offered  the most favorable conditions for  the  full  development  of oppressed  nations  and  peoples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  time  of  the  Revolution,  there  were  many  nationalities within  the  borders  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  which  the  characteristics  of  nationhood  had  not  yet  fully  matured,  and  in fact  had  been  suppressed  by  the  czars.  It  was  the  Soviet  system  itself  which  became  a  powerful  factor  in  the  consolidation of  these  nationalities  into  nations,  as  socialist  industry  and collective  farming  created  the  economic  basis  for  this  consolidation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  observed this firsthand in the Crimea and the Caucasus during my  visits  there in  the summers  of  1927  and  1928.  The languages</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  culture  which  had  been stifled  under the czarist  regime were now  being developed.  The  language  of the Crimean  people was a Turko-Tartar  language,  but  before  the  Revolution,  almost  all education,  such  as  there  was,  was  in  the  Russian  language.  Now there  were  schools  established  which  used  the  native  language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  and  other  students  made  similar  observations  when  they traveled  to  different  areas  of the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  meantime,  1  was  having  my  own  problems  with  the Russian  language.  On  first  hearing  it,  the language  had  sounded most  strange  to  me.  I  could  hardly  understand  a  word  and wondered  if  1  would  ever  be  able  to  master  it.  As  the  youngest Black  American,  I  applied  myself seriously to its study.  The first hurdle was the Cyrillic alphabet—its uniquely different characters intimidated  me.  But the crash course at KUTVA, lasting about an hour and  a  half per  day,  soon  broke  down  this  initial  barrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  In addition, I studied on my own for a couple of hours each day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  would  set  out  to  memorize  twenty  new  words  a  day.  Then  at night,  I  would  write  them  out  on  a  sheet  of paper  and  pin them above the mirror in  my room.  I would then go over them again in the  morning while shaving, and during the day l would make sure to  use them  in  conversation  with  the  Russians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">English  grammar  had  always  seemed  irrelevant  to  me,  but  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon  came to appreciate the  logic of Russian grammar.  In fact,  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">learned  most  of  my  English  grammar  through  the  study  of Russian.  Its  rules  were  consistent  and  understandable.  The language soon ceased to be mysterious  and revealed itself as being beautifully  and  simply  constructed.  In  six  months  1  was  able  to read   <i class="calibre4">Pravda</i>  with  the  help  of a  dictionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">KUTVA:  STRUCTURE AND  STUDIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  school  structure  was  fairly  complicated,  but,  as  I  saw  it, thoroughly democratic. There was the collective, the general body which included everybody in the school—from the rector, faculty, students,  clerical  and  maintenance  workers  to  the  scrubwoman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  leading body of the collective was the bureau...composed  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">161</p>
<p class="calibre1">representatives  elected  by  the  various  groups  in  the  university. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was also a Communist Party organization which played the leadership  role at  all  levels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally established by the Council of Nationalities, KUTVA was  now  a  Party  school,  administered  by  the  Educational Department  (AGITPROP)  of  the  Central  Committee  of  the CPSU.  There  was  a  direct  representative  of  the  Party,  called  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Party strengthener,” in the school administration. Together with the rector and  a representative  of the students,  he was part of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“troika”  which  constituted  the  top  leadership  of the  school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Students  had  the  rights of citizens, voting and  participating in local  elections.  The school discussed  and  dealt  with all the issues which Soviet workers and peasants discussed at their work places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  with  all  students  who  pursued  courses in  higher education in the  Soviet  Union,  we  at  KUTVA  received  full  room  and  board, clothes  and  a  small  stipend  for  spending  money.  There  was,  of course,  no tuition.  We used  to attend  workers’ cultural clubs and do  volunteer  work,  like  working  Saturdays  to  help  build  the Moscow subways.  Education for us was not an ivory tower, but a true  integration  into  the  Soviet  society,  where  we  received firsthand  knowledge  from  our  experiences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  curriculum  (which  was  a three-year course) was  based  on Marxism-Leninism;  that  is,  the teachings of Marx and  Engels as developed by Lenin. It included dialectical and historical materialism,  the  Marxist  world  concept;  the  Marxist  theory  of  class struggle  as  the  motive  force  of  human  events;  the  economic doctrines  of  Marx:  value  and  surplus  value,  as  a  key  to  understanding  history  by  revealing  the  economic  law  of  motion  of modern  capitalist  societies;  Lenin’s  analysis  of  imperialism,  the highest  stage  of capitalism;  theory  and  tactics  of the proletarian revolution  and dictatorship of the proletariat  and its Soviet state form; the problems of socialist construction; Lenin’s theory on the peasant question  -the alliance of workers and peasants as the base for Soviet power; the national and colonial questions; and the role of the  party  as  vanguard  of the  proletariat.  We  also  studied  the specific  history  of the  CPSU. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  favorite  teacher  was  Endr^Sik,  who  taught  courses  on</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leninism  and  the  history  of the  Soviet  Party.  Sik  was a striking young man.  His distinguishing feature was a large shock of white hair, unusual for a man so young  -he was probably in his thirties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  soft-spoken  and  modest.  Wc  all  loved  Sik;  he  was  an outgoing  person  who  radiated  warmth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sik was a Hungarian, a political refugee living in Russia. He had been  a  soldier  in  the  Austro-Hungarian  Army  during  the  First World  War.  Captured  by  the  Russians,  he  was  converted  to Bolshevism while in a Russian prison camp. On his release, he had gone  baek  to  Hungary  and  participated  in  the  short-lived  (133 </p>
<p class="calibre1">days) Hungarian Soviet government of 1919 of Bela Kun. With the defeat of the  Bela Kun government, Sik— along with hundreds of other revolutionaries —fled to the Soviet Union.  Hungarian exiles made up one of Moscow’s largest foreign colonies. In Moscow, Sik pursued an aeademic career. He was a graduate of the Institute of Red  Professors  and  like  many  Hungarian  intellectuals,  he  was multilingual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For all his good nature, Sik seemed tired and harassed.  He was teaching in many schools, in addition to activity in the Hungarian community.  Seven years after the defeat of the Hungarian Soviet, the exiled  revolutionaries were bitterly divided and factionalized, laying  blame  on  each  other  for the  failure  of the  revolutioa Sik  became  deeply  interested  in  the  question  of Blacks  in  the United  States  and  undertook a serious study of the question.  He read  all the  books available  and  also asked  the Black students at KUTVA  to  join  with  him.  Unfortunately  for  our  personal relationship,  Sik  and  I  were  to  find  ourselves  on  opposite sides of the fence in the discussion of Black Americans which took plaee at  the  Sixth  Congress  of  the  Communist  International  in  June 1928. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  tcaeher  of  Marxist  economics  was  a  young  man  by  the name  of  Rubenstein,  a  Russian  economist  in  the  Gosplan (Governmental Planning Commission). The star pupil in that class turned  out  to  be  our  modest  friend  Golden.  Golden,  who  had known  nothing  about  Marxism  before  eoming  to  the  Soviet Union,  was  able  to  grasp  the  intricacies  of  Marx’s   <i class="calibre4">Capital</i> and <i class="calibre4">Value</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Price  and  Profit</i>  seemingly  without  effort. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">163</p>
<p class="calibre1">A class that stands out in my memory was one on how to make a revolution, to seize power onee the situation was ripe. This course consisted  of a series of lectures by a young Red  Army officer.  He had  been a hcroie figure  in the  Moscow uprising of 1917  and the subsequent  seizure of power by the Bolsheviks in that city. A tall, handsome  young  man  of  bourgeois  background,  he  had  been  a lieutenant  in  the  army  of the  Kerensky  government.  Like  many other soldiers, he had been won over by the Bolsheviks on the basis of their  demands,  which reflected the needs of the people*,  peace, bread  and  land.  To  him, the Moscow uprising against Kerensky, led by the  Bolsheviks, was a model for the coming seizure of power in the  big  cities  of the capitalist  world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had  a large map of Moseow on the wall and would use it to illustrate how it had been done.  The call for the uprising, he said, had  come  to  the  Moseow  Communist  Party  by  telephone  from Leningrad,  where  the  revolutionary  workers,  sailors  and  army under  the  leadership  of  Lenin  had  overthrown  the  Kerensky government  and  seized  power  in  that  eity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Moscow, the  Party organization, already prepared, issued a call  to  the  people for an uprising.  His  regiment,  stationed on the outskirts  of the  eity,  together with  red  guards (workers"  militia), responded and  began to march towards the center of the city. The White  Guardists  were  concentrated  in  the  Arbot  and  in  the Kremlin.  Here  he  pointed  out,  in  Russian  and  other  European cities, the working class districts were centered around factories on the  outskirts  of  the  city  and  Moseow  was  circled  by  workers suburbs. Together with defected units of other regiments and with red guards, they marehed towards Moscow’s eentral area, whence fighting spread  throughout  the city-  even into the trans-Moscow district.  The  reds  finally  wiped  out  the  White  Guardist  strongholds,  and  the  Kremlin,  which  had  ehanged  hands  two  times before  in the  fighting,  finally  surrendered, Moscow  was  ours! </p>

<p class="calibre1">Soviet  Union  were  subdivided  into  three  main  language  groups: English,  French  and  Chinese.  English  and  French  were  the dominant  languages of the many colonial areas represented at the university.  Spanish was later added when Latin American students began  to  arrive.  In  addition  to  ourselves,  the  English-speaking group included East Indians, Koreans, Japanese and Indonesians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  had  many  close friends  in  this  latter  group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of the most  interesting and brilliant was an Indian student by the name of Sakorov. (They all took Russian names because of the  severe  repression  which  they  faced  back  home.)  A  former machinist  in  a  Detroit  auto  plant,  Sakorov  had  been sent to  the school  by  the  American  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally from  Bombay,  Sakorov had gone to sea on a British ship at the age of twelve and had been subjected to very oppressive conditions  his  whole  career  at  sea.  He eventually jumped  ship in Baltimore  and  wound  up working in an  auto  plant in Detroit.  Of all the group of students, he was the closest to us Blacks.  He knew first hand  the plight of Blacks  in the  United  States, and as a dark skinned  Indian,  he  had  experienced  much  of  the  same  type  of racial  abuse  while  there.  After  he  left  the  school,  he  returned  to India,  where  he  became  one  of  the  founders  of  the  Indian Communist  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later, more Indian students were to come, including one sixteen year old—a tall, lanky boy who took the name of Volkov.  He had been born in California; his parents were Sikhs who had migrated to  the  U.S.  and  worked  as  agricultural  workers  in  the  Imperial Valley of California. They were part of a foreign contingent of the Ghadr Party, a revolutionary nationalist party of Sikhs which had been organized in 1916. The Party would pick out young men to be future leaders; Volkov was chosen and sent to Japan for education and  stayed  there  a  year.  Then  he  was  sent  to study in the Soviet Union,  perhaps  by  the  Japanese  Party.  He  spoke Japanese  and English. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the  Indian students was a group of about  half a dozen Sikhs,  former  professional  soldiers,  survivors  of the  Hong Kong massacre  of  1926.  On  the  pretext  of  quelling  an  “imminent mutiny,**  the  British  colonel  of  the  regiment  stationed  in  Hong</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">165</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kong  had  called  the  unarmed  Sikh  soldiers  into  the  regimental square  and  turned  machine  guns  on  them.  (All  regiments  in  the Indian  Army  included  a  British  machine  gun  company  as  a safeguard against mutiny.) Several hundred were killed or wounded.  As  I  understood  it,  the  massacre was  engineered  to quell  the protests  over  conditions  which  were  being raised  by  members of the  Ghadr  Party  and  its  supporters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  group  who  arrived  in  Moscow  were  among  the  few  who escaped over the walls; they had fled to Shanghai where they were taken  in  charge  by  M.N.  Roy,  an  Indian  and  then  Comintern representative  to  China.  Roy  sent  them  to  Moscow.  These students,  some  of them  older  grey-bearded  men,  had  spent their whole lives in the British Indian Army. They represented a special problem  for the school,  because most of them  had  had very little education of any kind.  They were not  brought into  our class, but were  put  into  a  special  group  under  the  tutelage  of  Volkov, Sakorov and  other  of the  regular  Indian  students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was  my good  fortune to meet  many of these  Indian students again in  1942, when 1 was in  Bombay as a merchant seaman. Most of them  were  leading  figures  in  the  Indian  revolutionary  movement.  Sakorov  had  been  a  defendant  in one  of the Merut trials, having been charged with “conspiracy against the king* Since his return to India, he had spent eleven years in prison. Nada, another former  schoolmate,  was  president  of  the  Indian  Friends  of the Soviet  Union  and  very  active  among the  students  and  youth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were several Koreans and Japanese at the school, and two Indonesians.  I  remember  Dirja  particularly  well.  A  Dutch-educated Indonesian intellectual, he was an old revolutionary who had  spent  many years  in  prison. There was another Indonesian, a young man (whose name  I  cannot recall),  who later emerged as a communist leader and was killed in the Indonesian revolt of 1946. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kemal Pasha (a party name conferred on him by Sakorov) was a grey-eyed Moroccan from the Riffian tribe of Abdul Krim. I met Kemal Pasha again in  Paris during the Spanish  Civil War. There were also two whites in the group—June Kroll, then the wife of an American  communist  leader,  Carl  Reeves;  and  Max  Halff,  a young  English  lad  of  Russian-Jewish  parentage. </p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACKS  IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">We students were a fairly congenial lot and in particular  1 got to  know  the  other  Black  students  quite  well.  Golden  was  a handsome, jet-Black man; a former Tuskegee student and a dining car waiter.  He was not a member of the Communist Party, but was a  good  friend  of  Lovett  Fort-Whiteman,  head  of  the  Party’s Afro-American  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden  told  me  that  his coming to the  Soviet Union  had  been accidental.  He  had  run  into  Fort-Whiteman,  a  fellow  student  at Tuskcgee,  on  the  streets  of  Chicago.  Fort-Whiteman  had  just returned  from  Russia  and  was  dressed  in  a  Russian  blouse  and hoots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Golden related it:  “I asked  Fort-Whiteman what the hell he w$s  wearing.  Had  he  come off the stage and  forgotten to change clothes? He informed me that these were Russian clothes and that he  had just  returned  from  that  country.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden at first thought it was a put-on, but became interested as Fort-Whiteman  talked  about  his  experiences.  "Then  out  of the blue,  he asks  me  if I  want to go to  Russia as a student.  At first,  I thoughl  he was  kidding, but  man,  1 would have done anything to get  off  those  dining  cars!  I  was  finally  convinced  that  he  was serious. ‘But Pm married,’ 1 told him. ‘What about my wife?’‘Why, bring  her  along too!’  he  replied.  He  took  me  to  his  office  at  the American  Negro  Labor  Congress,  an  impressive  set-up  with  a secretary, and I was convinced,  Fort-Whiteman gave me money to get passports, and the next thing I knew, a couple of weeks later we were  on  the  boat with Otto and  the others on  the way to  Russia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  here  I  am  now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  a  keen  sense  of humor and kidded the rest  of us a lot, particularly  Otto.  His Southern accent carried over into Russian, and wc teased him about being the only person who spoke Russian with  a  Mississippi  accent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then there was Bankole, an African who spent most of his time with  the  Black  Americans,  He  was  an  Ashanti,  from  the  Gold Coast  (now  Ghana)  and  his  family  was  part  of the  African elite. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The son of a wealthy barrister, his family had sent him to London University  to  study  journalism.  From  there,  he .had  gone  to Carnegie Tech  in  Pittsburgh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  been on the road  to becoming a perennial student and had  planned  to  continue  at  McGill  University  in  Montreal,  but was recruited  to  the Young Communist  League in  Pittsburgh.  In the States, he was confronted with a racism more blatant than any he had met before.  I gathered that this had struck him sharply and had  been  largely  responsible for  his  move to  the  left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  hrothcr Otto had become sort  of a  character in the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was popular among the students, who immediately translated his  pseudonym  “John Jones”  into the  Russian “Ivan  Ivanovich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto had absolutely no tolerance for red tape, and he had hecome a mortal  enemy  of  the   <i class="calibre4">apparatchiki</i>  (petty  bureaucrats)  in  the school.  He had built a reputation for making their lives miserable, and  when  they  saw  him  coming,  they  would  huddle  in a corner: </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here  comes  Ivan  Ivanovich.  <i class="calibre4">Ostorozhno</i> (watch out)!  <i class="calibre4">Bolshoi</i> <i class="calibre4">skandal budyet</i>  (this  guy  will  make  a  big  scandal)!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harold  Williams  of  Chicago  was  a  West  Indian  and  former seaman  in the British merchant marine.  He had adopted the name of Dessalines, one of the three leaders of the Haitian revolution of the 1790s.  Williams had little formal education and some difficulty in  grasping  theory,  but  was  instinctively  a  class-conscious  guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, there was Mahoney, whose name in the USSR was Jim Farmer.  Farmer  was  a steelworker from  East  Liverpool,  Ohio, a Communist  Party member and had played a  leading role in local struggles  in  the  steel  mills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were only eight of us Blacks in a city of 4,500,000 people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to the six students, there were also two Black American women  who  had  long  residence  (since  before  the  Revolution) in Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  only  knew one of the women,  Emma Harris.  We first met on the  occasion  of  the  death  of Jane  Golden.  Emma  was  a  warm, outgoing and earthy middle-aged woman, originally from Georgia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was evident that she had once been quite handsome-  of the type that  in  the  old  days  wc called a “teasin’  brown.”  Emma had  first come to Moscow as a member of a Black song and dance group, a</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowly  hoofer  in  the  world  of  cheap  vaudeville.  Having  been deserted  by  its manager, the group was  left stranded  in  Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  others  had  evidently  made  their  way  back  to  the States,  Emma  had  decided  to  stay.  She  had  liked  the  country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here, being Black wasn’t a liability, but on the contrary, a definite asset.  With  her  drive  and  ambition  to  be  “somebody,”  Emma parlayed  this  asset  into  a  profitable  position.  She  married  a Russian  who  installed  her,  it  seems,  as  a  madam  of  a  house  of prostitution.  It was  no  ordinary  house, she once explained to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our clients were the wealthy and nobility.” To the former hoofer, this  was  status. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  was  Emma’s  situation  in  November  1917,  when  the Russian Bolsheviks and  Red  Guards  moved in from the proletarian suburbs of Moscow to capture the bourgeois inner city and the Kremlin.  During  some  mopping-up  operations,  Emma’s  house Was  raided  by  the  Cheka (the  security police).  A  bunch of White Guardists  had  holed  up  there  and  the whole group was arrested, including  Emma.  They  were  taken  to  the  Lubyanka  Prison  and some  of  the  more  notorious  White  Guardists  were  summarily executed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emma remained in a cell for a few days.  Finally she was called up before a Cheka official.  He told her that they were looking into her  case.  Many  of the people who  had  been  arrested at her place were  counter-revolutionaries  and  conspirators  against  the  new Soviet  state,  and  some  had  been  shot.  Emma disclaimed  knowledge  of  any  conspiracy  and  stated  that  she  was  engaged  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">“legitimate” business and had nothing to do with the politics of her clients. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y ou know the only reason we didn’t shoot you was because you are  a Negro woman,” the official said.  To  her surprise, he added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  arc  free  to  go  now.  I  advise  you  to  try  to find some useful work.  Keep  out  of trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When we met Emma, she had become a textile worker. She lived with  a  young  Russian  woman  -also  a  textile  worker,  whom  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">suspected was a reformed prostitute—in a two-room apartment in an  old  working class  district  near   <i class="calibre4">Krasnaya  Voroia</i> (Red  Gate). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon  after the  first  Black  students  arrived,  she sought  them  out</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">169</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  greeted  them  like  long  lost  kinfolk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At least once a month, we students would pool part of the small slipends  we  received  and  give  Emma  money  to  shop  for  and prepare  some  old  home  cooking  for  us.  On  these  occasions,  she would regale us with stories from her past life.  At times one could detect  a  fleeting  expression  of sadness,  of nostalgia,  for  her  old days  of affluence.  One could see that  she  had  never become fully adjusted  to  the  new  life  under  the  Soviets.  While  not  openly hostile,  it was clear that she was not an ardent partisan of the new regime.  Knowing our sentiments, she avoided political discussion and  kept  her  views  to  herself.  Our  feelings  toward  her  were warmest when we first arrived, but as we developed more ties with I he Russians, we went by to see her less often.  But we did continue lo visit her periodically; she was a sort of mother figure for us, and we all felt sorry for her. She was getting old  and often expressed a desire to  return  to the States.  She was finally able to return home after  World  War  II. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless  to  say,  Blacks  attracted  the  curiosity  of the  Muscovites.  Children  followed  us  in  the streets.  If we  paused to greet  a friend,  we  found  ourselves  instantly  surrounded  by  curious crowds—unabashedly  staring  at  us.  Once,  while  strolling  down Tverskaya, Otto and  I  stopped  to  greet  a white American friend and immediately found ourselves surrounded by curious Russians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  friendly  curiosity  which  we  took  in  stride.  A  young Russian woman stepped forward and began to upbraid and lecture the  crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are you staring at these people? They're human beings the same as us.  Do you want them to think that we’re savages?  <i class="calibre4">Eta ne</i> <i class="calibre4">kultumya! </i> (That  is  uncultured!)”  The  last  was  an  epithet  and in those  days  a  high  insult. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Eta  ne po-Sovietski! </i>  (It’s  not  the  Soviet  way!)”  she  scolded them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that point,  someone  in  the crowd calmly  responded:  “Well, eitizcncss,  it’s  a  free  country,  isn’t  it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were not offended,  but  amused.  We understood all this for what  it  was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was one occasion when Otto, Farmer, Bankolc and 1 were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a><img src="index-178_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">170</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">walking down Tverskaya.  Bankole, of course, stood out—attracting more attention than the rest of us with his English cut Savile Row  suit,  monocle  and  cane—a  black  edition  of  a  British aristocrat.  We  found  ourselves  being  followed  by  a  group  of Russian  children,  who  shouted:   <i class="calibre4">"Jass  Band... Jass  Band!" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto,  Farmer and  I were amused  at the incident  and  took it in stride.  Bankole,  however,  shaking  with  rage  at  the  implication, jerked  around  to  confront  them.  His  monocle  fell  off  as  he shouted:   <i class="calibre4">"Net Jans Band!Net Jass Band!" </i>  As he spoke, he hit his cane  on  the  ground  for  emphasis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evidently,  to  these  kids,  a  jazz  band  was  not just  a  group  of musicians, but a  race or tribe of people to which we must belong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  obviously  thought  we  were with  Leland  and  Drayton,  the musicians  l  had  met  in  Berlin,  They  had  been  a  big  hit  with  the Muscovites.  We  pulled  Bankole  away,  “Cmon  man,  cut  it  out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They don’t  mean  anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Soviet Union, remnants of national and racial prejudices from the old  society were attacked by education and law. It was a crime to give or receive direct or indirect privileges, or to exercise discrimination  because of race or nationality.  Any manifestation of racial  or  national  superiority  was  punishable  by  law  and  was regarded  as  a  serious  political  offense,  a  social  crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During my entire stay in the Soviet  Union, I encountered only one  incident  of  racial  hostility.  It  was  on  a  Moscow  streetcar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several  of us  Black  students  had  boarded  the  car  on our way  to spend an evening with our friend MacCloud.  It was after rush hour and the car was only about half filled with Russian passengers. As usual,  we  were  the  objects  of  friendly  curiosity.  At  one  stop,  a drunken  Russian  staggered  aboard.  Seeing us,  he  muttered  (but loud  enough  for  the whole  car  to  hear)  something about “Black devils  in  our country.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  group  of outraged  Russian passengers thereupon seized him and ordered the motorman to stop the car.  It was a citizen’s arrest, the  first  l  had  ever  witnessed.  “How  dare  you,  you  scum,  insult people who  are the  guests of our  country!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  then  occurred  was  an  impromptu,  on-the-spot  meeting, where they debated what to do with the man.  1 was to see many of</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">171</p>
<p class="calibre1">this  kind  of “meeting*  during my  stay in  Russia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was decided to take the culprit to the police station which, the conductor  informed  them,  was a few  blocks ahead.  Upon arrival there,  they  hustled  the drunk  out  of the car  and  insisted  that  we Blacks,  as  the  injured  parties,  come  along to  make  the  charges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first we demurred, saying that the man was obviously drunk and  not  responsible for his  remarks.  “No, citizens,* said a young man (who  had done most of the talking), “drunk or not, we don’t allow this sort of thing in our country.  You must come with us to the  militia (police)  station  and  prefer charges  against  this  man*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  car  stopped  in  front  of the  station.  The  poor drunk  was hustled  off and  all the  passengers came along. The defendant had sobered  up  somewhat  by this time and  began apologizing before we  had  even entered  the building.  We got to the commandant  of the station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  drunk  swore  that  he  didn’t  mean  what  he’d  said.  “I  was drunk and angry about something else. I swear to you citizens that I  have  no  race  prejudice  against  those  Black   <i class="calibre4">gospoda</i>  (gentlemen).*</p>
<p class="calibre1">We  actually  felt  sorry  for  the poor fellow  and  we accepted  his apology.  Wc  didn’t  want to  press  the matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,* said the commandant, “we’ll keep him overnight. Perhaps this  will  be a  lesson  to  him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">BIG BILL HAYWOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition  to  the  students  at  KUTVA  and  the  two  Black women, there was a sizeable  American colony  in Moscow during my  stay  there.  There  were  political  representatives  of the  Communist  Party  USA  to  the  Comintern,  the  Profintern,  the  Crestintern  and  to  the departments,  bureaus  and  secretaries  of these organizations—holding  jobs  as  translators,  stenographers  and researchers.6</p>
<p class="calibre1">Soviet  cultural  and  publishing  organizations  also  employed U,S,  citizens, and  in addition to the political groups, there were a number of technical and skilled workers who came as specialists to</p>

<p class="calibre1">172</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">work  for  the  new  Soviet  state.  I  got  to  know  a  number  of  the Americans  during  my  stay,  both  official  reps  and  others  in  the colony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Big  Bill  Haywood  was  perhaps  the  most  famous  of these.  He was  organizer  and  founder of the  IWW, and a great friend  of all Blacks in  Moscow.  At  the time 1  met him he was in his late fifties and  quite ill, suffering from diabetes.  Physically,  he was only the shell  of the  man  he  had  once  been.  He  called  himself a  political refugee from American  capitalism.  As a sick man, he had fled the U.S.  to avoid a ten-year frame-up  prison sentence which he knew he would never have survived. Bill was blind in one eye, over which he  wore  a  black  patch.  I  had  imagined  the  loss  of his  eye  had happened in  a  fight with company or  police thugs and was rather disappointed to learn that it was the result of a childhood accident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the Soviet  Union  he had participated in the organization of tbe  Kuzbas  Colony.  This  project  was  to  reopen  and  operate industry in the Kuznetsk  Basin in the Urals, closed during the Civil War period.  The colony was located about a thousand miles from Moscow  in  an  area  of enormous  coal  deposits,  vital  to  socialist industrialization.  The district, with its  mines and deserted chemical  plants,  had  been  established  by  the  Soviet  government as an autonomous colony.  Big Bill  had  brought a  number of American skilled  workers,  many of whom  were old Wobblies, to reopen the plants  and  mines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Big  Bill  became  a  member  of  the  CPUSA  at  its  founding convention  in  1921,  and  while  in  the  Soviet  Union  he  was  a member of the CPSU.  Bill  and  his devoted wife,  a Russian office worker,  lived  in  the  Lux  Hotel  a  Comintern  hostelry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  room  had  become  a  center for  the  gathering of American radicals,  especially  old  Wobblies  passing through  or  working  in the Soviet Union.  Here they would gather on a Saturday night and reminisce about old times  and  discuss current problems.  Often a bunch of us Black students were present. Sometimes these sessions would carry on all night until Sunday morning. There were only a few  chairs  in  the  room,  and  Bill  would  sit  in  a  huge  armchair surrounded  by people sitting on the floor.  For us Blacks, listening to Big Bill was like a course on the American  labor movement.  He</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">173</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a  bitter  enemy  of  racism,  which  he  saw  as  the  mainstay  of capitalist  domination  over the  U.S.  working  class,  a  continuous brake on labor unity. This attitude was reflected in the preamble of the  1WW  constitution,  he  told  us.  It  read:  “No  working  man  or woman  shall  be excluded from  membership  in  unions  because  of creed  or  color.”  This  was  borne  out  in  practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  IWW  was  the  first  labor organization  in modern times to invade the South and break down racial barriers in that benighted region.  He  recounted  his  experiences  in  the  organizing  drives among  Southern  lumber  workers  in  Louisiana  and  Texas.  This resulted  in  the  organization  of  the  Brotherhood  of  Timber Workers  in  1910,  an  independent  union  in  the  lumber  camps  of Louisiana,  Texas  and  Arkansas.  At  its  height  this  union  had 25,000  members,  half of them  Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Big Bill  described  how the IWW  broke down discrimination at the first convention  of this union.  He had come from the national IWW  office  to  speak  to  the  convention.  They  were  all  white,  he said,  and  he  inquired  why  no  colored men  were  present.  He was told that the Louisiana state law prohibited meetings of Black and white —the  Negro  brothers  were  meeting  in  another hall nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill recalled that he then told them: “Damn the law! It’s the law of the  lumber  bosses.  Its  objective  is to defeat you and  to keep you divided  and  you’re  not  going  to  get  anywhere  by  obeying  the dictates of the bosses.  You’ve got to meet together.” And the latter is  exactly  what  they  did,  he  told  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  remember  that  a  few  days  after  one  of  these  gatherings  we telephoned  to  tell  him  that  we  were  coming  over,  only  to  learn from  his  wife  that  he  had  had  a  stroke  and  was  in  the  Kremlin hospital.  She said that  he was getting along OK,  but  couldn’t see visitors.  After  several  weeks  he  returned  home.  Still  weak,  he received  many  of  his  friends,  and  many  of  the  delegates  to  the Fourth  Congress  of the  Profintern  which  was  in  Moscow  at  the time.  Big Bill  had  been a  leading participant  in this organization since  its  inception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then suddenly,  he was back in the hospital, where he died  May 18,  1928.  The whole American colony  turned  out for the funeral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  delegations  from  the  Russian  Communist  Party,  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">which  he  was  a  member,  and  from  the  various  international organizations in which he had  played a role. The Fourth Congress of the  RiLU  adjourned  its  sessions,  and  representatives of trade unions  from  all  over the world  attended  the  funeral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m  sure  for all  us  Black  students,  our  meeting and friendship with  this great  man were among the most  memorable experiences of our stay  in  Moscow.  A stalwart  son of the  American working class,  Bill’s  life  and  battles  represented  its  best  traditions.  Tct Blacks, he was a man who would not only stand up with you, but if need  be,  go  down  with  you.  This  was  the  iron  test  in  the  fight against  the common  enemy,  U.S.  capitalism.  Big  Bill  obviously understood  from  his  own  experience  the  truth  of the  Marxian maxim that in the U.S., “labor in the white skin can never be free as long as  in  the  Black  it  is  branded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">^NA</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">l first met my second wife, Ekaterina—Ina—in December 1926. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  were  both  at  a  party  at  the  home  of  Rose  Bennett,  a British woman who had married M.  Petrovsky (Bennett), the chairman of the Anglo-American Commission of the Comintern and formerly Cl  representative  to  Great  Britain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ina was one of a group of ballet students whom Rose had invited to  meet  some  of  us  KUTVA  students.  She  was  a  small  young woman  of  nineteen  or  twenty,  shy  and  retiring,  and  sat  off removed  from  the  party.  After  that  party,  we  met  several  times, and  she  told  me about  herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  born  in  Vladikavkaz  (in  northern  Caucasus),  the daughter of the mayor of the town.  It was one of those towns that was  taken  and  rc-taken  during  the  Civil  War,  one  time  by  the whites, then by the reds. On one occasion when the town fell to the reds,  her father was accused of collaborating with the whites. The reds came and arrested him and she never saw him again.  Ina was about eleven at the time; she later learned that her father had been executed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  uncle was a  famous artist in Moscow and after her father’s</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  STUDENT IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">175</p>
<p class="calibre1">execution  they  went  there  to  live.  Ina  told  me  of  her  trip  to Moscow  at the height of famine and a typhus epidemic; they rode in  freight  cars  several  days through  the Ukraine,  and saw people dying along the road.  Her uncle took charge of them and got them an apartment on Malaya Bronaya. He investigated the case of her father  and  discovered  that  a  mistake  had  been  made,  and  her father was  posthumously  exonerated.  As  a sort of compensation, she  and  her  mother  were  regarded  as  “social  activists,”  and  Ina entered school to study ballet. She later transferred from the ballet school to study English in preparation for work as a translator.  We lived together in the spring of 1927  and got married the following fall,  after  my  return  from  the  Crimea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  January  1927,1  was stunned  by the news of the death of my Mother.  One  morning,  when  I  was at  Ina’s  house,  Otto  burst  in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overcome by emotion, he could hardly talk, but managed to blurt out,  “Mom’s  dead!”  He had  a  letter from  our sister Eppa, with  a clipping  of Mother’s  obituary  from  the   <i class="calibre4">Chicago  Defender. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  the  headline  “Funeral  of  Mrs.  Harriet  Hall,”  was  her picture and an article which described her, a domestic worker, as a </p>
<p class="calibre1">“noted club woman.” She had been a member of the Black Eastern Star  and  several  other  lodges  and  burial  societies.  The  article mentioned  that  she  was  survived  by  her  husband,  daughter  and two  sons,  the  latter  in  Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  overcome with  grief and guilt at  not being home.  Deeply shocked,  I  had  always assumed that I would return to see Mother again.  Bom  a  slave,  her world  had been confined  to the  midwest and upper South.  She had once told me, “Son, I sure would like to sec the ocean,”  and  I  had glibly promised, “Oh, I’ll take you there someday,  Momma.”  1  felt  that  I  had  been her favorite;  1  was the responsible  one,  and  yet  1  hadn’t  been  able  to  do  what  I  had promised.  Worse yet, l wasn’t even there when she died. It took me some  time to  get  over  the  shock. </p>
