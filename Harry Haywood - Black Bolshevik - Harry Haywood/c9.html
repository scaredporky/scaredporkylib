<p class="calibre1">Chapter  9</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Sixth  Congress</b> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">of the  Comintern:</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A  Blow  Against  the  Right</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Sixth World Congress of the Comintern, held in Moscow in July and  August of 1928, was a historic turning point in the world communist  movement.  Early  in  July  the  first  U.S.  delegates arrived,  anxious  to  get  the  “lay  of  the  land*  and  to  scout  the political  situation  in  the  capital  of world  revolution.  As  1  recall, Lovestone’s  group  staked  out  headquarters  at  the  Lux  Hotel, while  the  Foster-Cannon  opposition  gathered  at  the  Bristol,  a short  distance  further  up  the  street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  number of us from the Lenin School were on hand  when  our comrades in the Foster group arrived. We got together to talk with a number of them, though Foster, Cannon and Bittelman were not present.  They were anxious to get a  report  on  the situation in the Soviet Party: Which leaders were involved in the right opposition? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  was  Bukharin  doing?  Where  did  he stand? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  gave  them  a  rundown  on  the  situation  as  we  saw  it.  The issues  in  the  discussion  included  industrialization,  the  five-year plan,  collectivization,  the  drive  against  the   <i class="calibre4">kulaks</i>  and  the  war danger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We told them about disagreements in the CPSU. There was talk of a hidden right faction involving such leaders as Rykov, Tomsky and  possibly Bukharin. Thus far, however, there were only rumors and  speculations.  The  fight  was  not  yet out  in  the open,  but  was confined  to the Politburo  and  the Central Committee.  A  plenum of the Central Committee  had  been called  on the eve of the Sixth</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a><img src="index-254_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">246</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Congress and was at that moment in session. We told them that we could  undoubtedly find  out at the congress if there  were any new developments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  their  part,  our  fellow  oppositionists  ran  down  the  latest developments  in  the  inner-Party  struggle  at  home.  We  already knew of the findings of a special American Commission which had been  set  up  at  the  Eighth  Plenum  of  the  Cl  in  May  1927.  The commission's  final  resolution  had  called  for  the  unconditional abolition  of all  factionalism.1  Both  sides  ignored  the resolution, however, as the most vicious factionalism continued in the Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  Fifth  Convention  of the  CPUSA  in  the  fall  of  1927,  the Love stone-Pep per  bunch  were  able  to  out-maneuver the  Foster-Cannon  opposition  and  win  control  of the  organizational  apparatus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Firmly  in  the  saddle  of  power  and  riding  high,  their support came  from  the  belief  on  the  part  of  the  membership  that  the Lovestone group had the endorsement of the Comintern—a myth assiduously  cultivated  by  the  Lovestone  cohorts.  They  were playing a deceitful game of double-bookkeeping, both with respect to  the  Comintern  as  well  as  to  the  membership  at  home.  Their method was to give lip  service to the light against the right danger, while  in  practice  undermining  its  application  and  attempting  to pin the label of “right" on the opposition. Typical of this duplicity was  their  sabotage  of the  line  of the  Red  International  of Labor Unions'  (RILU)  Fourth  Congress,  which  had  called  for  the formation  of  the  new  unions  in  industries  and  areas  where  the workers  were  unorganized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the U.S., the new upsurge in class struggle, combined with the refusal  of  the  AFL  craft-type  union  leaders  to  organize  the majority  of  industrial  workers,  demanded  that  the  communists take  the  lead  and  organize  the  unions  themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  this  point  in  the  discussion  it was  pointed  out  that  Foster himself was  still  not  clear on  the question of the formation of the new  unions.  Other  members  of the  grouping  admitted  that  they had also vacillated on the  question when it was first raised—after the decisions of the Fourth  RILU Congress—but it appeared that they  now  had  a  better  grasp  of the  matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a><img src="index-255_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS  OF THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">247</p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  question  of the  estimate  of the international situation, they pointed out that their record was clear, whereas the leadership definitely underestimated the economic crisis and radicalization of the  workers.  They  admitted  that  they  were  late  in  pressing  the question  of independent  unions, but now they had finally decided to  launch  textile,  mining  and  needle  trades  industrial  unions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovcstone  had jumped  on the  bandwagon  at the  last  minute as a loud trumpeter of the “new unions” line  in an attempt to clear his record  before  the  World  Congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the whole, our comrades were full of fight and optimistic at the outcome of placing their case before the World Congress. They seemed  sure that they would get a favorable hearing.  The strategy was  to  expose  the  Lovestone-Pepper  leadership  as  the  embodiment of the right danger in the U. S.  Party and to explode the myth of their Comintern support, thus laying the basis for the victory of the  opposition  at  the  next  Party  convention.  This  strategy  was pressed  at  the  numerous  caucus  meetings  of the  opposition  bloc which  I  attended  before and  during  the  congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  all  was  not  well  within  the  ranks  of the  opposition;  that much  was  evident  at  the  first  meeting  of our caucus.  Foster,  the leader of the minority, came under sharp attack for his vacillation on the question of the new unions from his immediate co-workers, Bittelman, Cannon,  Browder and Johnstone. Foster had not been alone in  his  resistance to the  new policy.  Most  of the members of the minority had vacillated on, if not openly resisted, the decisions of the  Ninth Plenum  and of the Fourth Congress of the RILU on this  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Foster  had  been  the  most  stubborn,  clinging  to  the  old policy  based  on  the  organized  workers,  rather than  the  unorganized,  which  placed  main  emphasis  on  work  within  the  old reactionary-dominated AFL unions. This policy, which Lozovsky had  caricatured  as “dancing a quadrille,..around the AFL and its various  unions,”2  regarded  the organization  of unions independent  of the  AFL  as “dual  unionism”...a heresy left  over from  the days  of the  IWW. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  a  month  before,  in  the  May  Plenum  of  the  CC  of  the CPUSA,  Foster  had  written  a trade  union  resolution which  was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a><img src="index-256_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">248</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">supported  by  Lovestone.  While  it  called  for  the  building  of independent  textile  and  miners’  unions,  it  still  reflected  many illusions as to  the gains communists could  make within the AFL. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster could not bring himself to fully criticize his earlier mistakes, which  left  Lovestone  free  to  use Foster as a cover for his rightist position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of this was bad for the minority; it blurred the image that it sought  to  present  to  the  congress—that  of  consistent  fighters against the  right danger.  There was a heated exchange at the first meeting of the minority caucus.  As I recall, Foster contended that he had not in principle been against the new turn, but against those who interpreted  it as a signal for desertion of the work  in the old unions.  It was clear that at this point  Foster had lost leadership (at least temporarily) of his own group. Bittelman was chosen to make the  report  for  the  minority  in  the  American  Commission  of the congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  tempers  still frayed,  we passed on to a brief exchange on the  Afro-American  question  and  the  proposed  new  line  on self-determination,  which  they  all  knew  was  coming up  for  full-dress  discussion  at  the  congress.  I  gave  a  brief  outline  of  the position  and  how  I  had  been  led to it  by the study of the Garvey movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then someone raised the inevitable question.  Wouldn’t  this be construed  as  an  endorsement  of  Black  separation?  Does  it  not conflict  with  the  struggle  against  segregation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster  objected  to  that  implication,  maintaining  that  self-determination  didn’t  necessarily  mean  separation.  He  drew,an analogy  to  our  trade  union  policy  with  respect  to  Blacks.  He pointed  out  the  necessity to  fight  for  the  organization  of Blacks and whites in one union  and against all segregation. But in unions where Jim Crow bars exclude Blacks, Foster said, we support their right to organize their own separate unions.  In such situations, the organization of Black unions should be regarded as a step toward eventual  unity  and  not  an  advocacy  of separation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  evident  that  Foster  had  studied  the  question  and  was attempting  to  relate  it  to  his own  practical experience.  While his analogy was  oversimplified,  he was clearly taking a correct stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a><img src="index-257_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH CONGRESS OF THE COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">249</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bittelman, as I recall, seemed the clearest of all. Perhaps this was as  a  result  of  his  Russian  revolutionary  background  and  some acquaintance with the Bolshevik policy on  the national question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pointed out  the necessity of making a distinction  between  the right  of separation and  separation itself. Separation or independence  is  only  one  of  the  options;  there  were  various  forms  of federation  as  Soviet experience had  shown.  The central question was one of building unity of Black and white workers against U. S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalism  and  this  could  be  achieved  only  by recognition  of the right  of self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  happy about  the support  given to  the position  by Foster and Bittelman. As the main theoretician of the minority, Bittelman had a great deal of influence.  Certainly there was unclarity among the  caucus  members,  but  by and large I  was favorably impressed by  this  first  airing  of  the  question.  After  all,  I  reasoned,  the proposed  new line did  represent  a  radical  shift from  past  policy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There seemed  to  be a modesty  among these people and a sincere desire to  give  the  matter  a full  hearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt that on the whole my comrades were an honest lot. Despite factional  considerations,  they  were  motivated  by  the  overriding desire to achieve clarity on a question which up to that point had frustrated  the  Party’s  best  efforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I n the caucus  meetings, I  had  my first close-up view of some of the leaders with whom I was to work in the future.  Mostly from the midwest, with genuine roots in the American labor tradition, they were  a  pretty  impressive  bunch.  Most  had  broad  mass  experience—especially  in  the  trade  union  field.  The  roots  of  the Lovestone  group  were  much  more  grounded  among  former functionaries  and  propagandists  of the  Socialist  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">William  Z.  Foster,  leader  of the  minority  bloc,  was  also  the leader  in  the  Party’s  trade  union  work.  A  self-educated  man,  he had  worked  at  a  number  of  trades,  including  longshoreman, seaman,  lumberjack,  street-car  conductor  and  railroad  worker.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Born  in  Massachusetts,  he spent  his early childhood  in  Philadelphia  and  came  into  prominence  as  a  trade  union  leader  in Chicago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had been a left socialist, then, for a brief period, joined with</p>

<p class="calibre1">the  Wobblies.  He  soon  clashed  with  them  on  the  issue  of  dual unionism.  Foster himself opted for the French syndicalist policy of boring from within the established unions.  He joined the Communist  Party  in the  summer of  1921  and  brought  an entire group  of trade  unionists  with  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Chicago, Foster was deeply involved in trade union work. He had served as business agent for the Brotherhood of Railroad Car Men  of  America;  was  a  founder  of  the  TUEL;  initiated  the nationwide  drive  to  organize the stockyard  workers  in  1917; and was leader of the  1919 steel strike, the attempt to organize 365,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">steelworkers.  It  was  in  this  strike  that  he  became  a  nationally known  left  trade  union  figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  time  I  saw  Foster  in  action  was  at  the  Fourth  Party Convention  in  Chicago  in  the  summer  of  1925.  I  remember  him angrily  pacing  with  clenched  fists  back  and  forth  across  the platform  behind  Ruthenbcrg  as  the  latter  berated  him  from the rostrum.  Here in the caucus, he was again an angry man, but under the  lashing  of his  friends  and  co-factionalists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack  Johnstone,  a  Scotsman,  still  had  the  Scot's  burr  in  his speech.  An ex-Wobbly and close co-worker of Foster, he had been one of the young radical Chicago trade unionists. A member of the Chicago Federation of Labor from the Painters Union, Johnstone was  a  leader  in  the  TUEL.  1  had  met  him  at  the  Fourth  RILU </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congress.  His  name  was  familiar  to  me  because  of his  role as  a leader  in  the  organization  of  the  Chicago  stockyard  workers  in which my sister had been involved. Johnstone was the organizer of the  drive for  the  Chicago  Federation  of Labor and later became secretary  of  the  Chicago  Stockyards  Council  with .55,000  white and  Black  members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the eve of the ‘1919 riots, he had helped to organize a parade of white  stockyard  unionists  through  the  Southside  in solidarity with  the  Black  workers.  I  had  the  pleasure  of  working  with Johnstone  later  in  Pittsburgh  and  in  Chicago,  where  he  was industrial  organizer for  the district.  He  was a quiet,  unassuming guy  with  a wry  sense  of humor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earl  Browder  of  Wichita,  Kansas,  served  his  ideological apprenticeship  as  a  radical  trade  unionist  in  the  socialist  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">cooperative  movements.  Arrested  in  1917  on  charges  of defying the  draft  law,  he  spent  three  years  in  the  federal  penitentiary  at Leavenworth,  Kansas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had known Browder briefly in  Moscow while he was rep to the Profintern, before  he went  on a two year mission to the  Far East for that organization. We KUTVA students would often visit him at  his  room  in the  Lux  Hotel where  he would play checkers with Golden,  who  usually  won.  He  told  us  that  when  he  was  at Leavenworth,  he  had  met  a  number  of  former  members  of  the Black  Twenty-fourth  Infantry  who  had  been  involved  in  the mutiny-riot in Houston, Texas, in the summer of 1917.  He told us that  they  often  played  baseball  together  in  prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  time,  Browder  seemed  to  me  to  be  a  quiet,  modest, unassuming  man.  But  at  this  caucus  meeting,  something  had happened  which  seemed  to  have  transformed  him  into  a  “new” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Browder.  Though  long  associated  with  Foster,  he  now  seemed bent  on  not  only  asserting his  independence,  but on establishing his  own  claim  to  leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At one  point  in the heated discussion on trade union policy, he exclaimed  sarcastically;  “You  expect  to  get  the  support  of the Comintern,  but  you’re  all  divided  among  yourselves!  There’s  a Cannon group, a Bittelman Group, a Foster Group—well, I’m for the  Browder  Group!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one seemed to take his remark seriously, but less than a year later  Browder was  to  emerge  as  secretary  of the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James  P.  Cannon  was  also  from  Kansas-  a  tall,  raw-boned midwesterner of Irish descent.  He came from the same trade union background  as  the  other  caucus  leaders;  he  had  been a traveling organizer  for the  Wobblies  and  an  editor  of a  number  of labor papers.  He was a supporter of Trotsky, although he didn’t admit it at  the congress.  Later he split from the Party and helped form the Trotskyist  Socialist  Workers  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill  Dunne  was  a  man  of  impressive  credentials.  Raised  in Minnesota,  Dunne  entered  the  trade  union  movement  as  an electrician.  Then  in  Butte,  Montana,  during  World  War  I,  he edited  the  Butte   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Bulletin</i>  (official  organ  of  the  Montana Federation  of  Labor  and  the  Butte  Central  Labor  Council). </p>

<p class="calibre1">252</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunne had been secretary of a local of electricians, vice-president of the  Montana  Federation  of  Labor  and  a  member of the state legislature  (on  the  Democratic  ticket,  which  in  Butte  was  labor controlled).  He  helped  organize  the  Socialist  Party  Branch  of Butte  and  brought  it  into  the  Communist  Labor  Party in  1919. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 got to know Bill quite well; he was in the Soviet Union for some months before the Sixth Congress as a Profintem rep. I  first met him  through  Clarence  Hathaway, and  both were associated with the Cannon sub-group.  Bill was familiar with the emerging line on self-determination and  supported  it.  He had written a  number of articles  on  Black  workers  in  the  mid-twenties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To me, he was the most colorful figure in our caucus and a man of  unusual  brilliance.  Keen-witted,  sharp  in  debate,  he  had  an extraordinary  sense  of  humor.  Of  Irish  and  French-Canadian parentage,  Bill  was  short  and  heavy-set,  with  black  bushy eyebrows. He cut a romantic figure on the streets of Moscow in his Georgian  <i class="calibre4">rabochka</i> and sheathed dagger at his waist. 1 had a close friendship  with  Bill  which  lasted  over  a  number  of years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexander Bittelman was a  Russian Jew who had emigrated to the  United  States  when  in  his  early  twenties.  A  little  fellow, Bittelman  was  both  ascetic  and  scholarly.  He  had  been  in  the socialist  movement  in  Russia  and  continued  on  in  his  political work  in  the  U.S.  A  serious  Marxist  student,  Bittelman was  the main  theoretician  for  the  Foster group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  LOVESTONE  CAUCUS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Lovestone-Pepper  caucus  was  meeting  at  the  same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They too were mapping out plans for the battle on the  floor of the congress.  Lovestone  also  had  his  troubles—most  involved  the shedding  of  his  opportunist  reputation  for  that  of  “crusader against  the  right  danger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of the  “big guns”  were on the scene:  Lovestone,  Pepper, Weinstone  and  Wolfe.  Gitlow,  Bedacht  and  others  were  left  at home  as  caretakers;  Gitlow  ostensibly  to  carry  on  the  Party's election  campaign (in  which  he was  vice-presidential candidate). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a><img src="index-261_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS OF THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">253</p>
<p class="calibre1">While  I  was  the  only  Black  in  the  minority  caucus,  the Lovestone-Pepper caucus claimed the allegiance, if not the ardent support,  of  a  number  of  leading  Black  comrades.  In  the  nine months  since  the  convention,  the  Lovestone-Peppcr  leadership had attempted  to  patch its fences in the work among Blacks. Otto Huiswood, now a  member of the Central  Committee and district organizer in Buffalo, was the first Black district organizer. Richard B.  Moore  was  assigned  to  the  International  Labor Defense,  and Cyril  P.  Briggs  was  editor  of   <i class="calibre4">The Crusader</i> News Service, which was  subsidized  by the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  none  of  these  could  be  called  ardent  supporters  of Lovestone.  They  were  all  dissatisfied  with  the  status  of  Afro-American work, which was reflected in the small number of Black cadre in the Party.  In general,  it  was still  difficult to draw  a hard and  fast distinction between the factions on questions concerning Afro-American  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacks  in the Lovestone delegation included  H.V.  Phillips and Fort-Whiteman  (both  directly  from  the  United  States)  and students  from  the  graduating  group  at  KUTVA—Otto,  Farmer and  Williams (Golden had already left for home). The group also included  William  L.  Patterson,  the  young  attorney  who  had worked  with  the  Party on the Sacco-Vanzetti  case  and  who had been  sent  to  KUTVA just  before  the congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James Ford, who worked  in the Profintern and was to become an outstanding Party leader in the thirties, stood aloof from both groups  as  I  remember.  His  sympathies  seemed  to  be  with  the Foster-Cannon  opposition,  however. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the  Blacks attending the congress,  I  was  the only  one supporting the new line on self-determination. The others insisted that “it was a race question, not a national question,” implying that the  solution  lay  through  assimilation  under  socialism.  Probing deeper,  I  found  that  most  were  hung  up  on  a  purist  and non-Marxist  concept  of  the  class  struggle  which  ruled  out  all strivings  towards  nationality  and  Black  identity  as  divisive, running counter  to  internationalism  and  Black  and  white  unity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an American version of the “pure proletarian revolution” </p>
<p class="calibre1">concept;  a  domestic  manifestation  of  the  old  deviation  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a><img src="index-262_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">254</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">socialist  and  communist  movements  against  which  Lenin,  Stalin and  others  had  fought  in the development of the Bolshevik policy on the  national  and  colonial  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recalling that I myself had held the same view just a few months back,  I  felt  that  the  resistance  of  Blacks  in  the  Party  to self-determination  would  be  overcome  through  exposure  in  the discussions  at  the  congress  of the  proposed  new  line.  1  had  no doubt  that they would  come to  sec, as 1  had, the grand irony of a situation  in  which  we  Blacks,  who  so  vociferously  complained about  our  white  comrades  underestimating  the  revolutionary significance  of  the  Afro-American  question,  were  guilty  of  the same  sin.  For  the  revolutionary  significance  of the  struggle  for Black  rights  lay  precisely  in  the  recognition  of  its  character  as essentially that of the struggle of an oppressed nation against U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  this  point,  the  opposition  to  the  idea  of  Black  self-determination  was  to  receive  theoretical  support  from  an unexpected source.  This opposition came from  Professor Sik, my old teacher at  KUTVA,  who  was  still  teaching the  Black students there.  Sik contended  that  bourgeois  race  ideology,  which  fostered  racial prejudices, was the prime factor in the oppression of U.S.  Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  their fight  for equal  rights should  be regarded  not  as that  of an oppressed  nation striving for equality via self-determination  but,  on  the  contrary,  as  the  fight  of an  oppressed  racial minority  (similar  to  the Jews  under  czarism)  for assimilation  as equals  into  U.S.  society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sik undoubtedly thought that he was presenting original views, but  stripped  of their pseudo-Marxist  phraseology,  they were the old  bourgeois-liberal  reformist  views.  He slurred  over the socioeconomic factors that  lay at the base of the question, factors which call  for  the completion  of the  agrarian-democratic  revolution  in the  South.  His  perspective  divested  the  Black  movement  of  its independent  revolutionary  thrust,  reducing  it  to  a  bourgeois-liberal  opposition  to  race  prejudice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  Sik\s  thesis  continued  to  be  used as a crutch for the right  opposition  over  the  next  year  or  so;  it  appeared  in  the <i class="calibre4">Communist International</i> (organ of the Comintern) in the midst of</p>

<p class="calibre1">the Sixth World Congress.4 But t he pressure for a turn to the left in this  work  was  to  flush  it  out  into  the  open  along  with  other right-wing  views  on the  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foremost  among  these  were  the  views  of Jay  Lovestone.  His view  of  Southern  Blacks  as  a  “reserve  of  capitalist  reaction” </p>
<p class="calibre1">provided  a  theoretical  rationale  for  the  Party’s  chronic  underestimation of the question.  This was clear in his report to the Fifth Party  Convention  in  which  he contended  that*. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  migration  of  Negroes  from  the  South  to  the  North  is another means  of proletarianization, consequently the existence of this group as a reserve of capitalist reaction is likewise being undermined.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovestone held  that  the masses of Blacks  in the South become potentially revolutionary only through migration to the industrial centers in the north and  participation in class struggle along with white  workers.  This  viewpoint,  which  was  later  to  become  a cornerstone for his theory of “American exceptionalism," was first outlined  in  his  report  for the  Fifth  Convention of the Party  and again  in  his  report  in the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i>  in  February  1928.6 But these articles passed unnoticed at the time. It was only on the eve of the Sixth  World  Congress  and  under the pressure of the new line that  we  became alerted  to  Lovestonc’s  views. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The general meeting of the American delegation took place the day  before  the  opening  of  the  congress.  All  factions  were represented  but, as I recall, there were no fireworks.  By that time, lines were clearly drawn and neither faction was trying to convince the  other.  On  our  part,  we  were saving  our  ammunition  for the battle  on  the  floor  of the  congress and  its  commissions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently  there  had  been  some  objections  in  the  Lovestone group to the proposed new  line on self-determination. To mollify these  people,  Lovestone  stated  that  he  stood  for  the  right  of self-determination  of  oppressed  peoples  everywhere;  surely  he said,  no  communist  could  oppose  this  right.  I  assumed  that  he regarded the slogan as some sort of showcase principle; something to  be  declared  but  which  did  not  commit  its  advocates  to  any special  line  of  action.  Lovestone  knew  which  way  the  wind  was</p>

These commissions included the American Negro/South African  Commission,  Colonial Commission, Trade  Union Commission,  and  Program  Commission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  SIXTH  WORLD  CONGRESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">On  July  17,  1928,  532 delegates  representing fifty-seven parties and nine organizations assembled in the Hall of the Trade Unions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  delegation  from  the  United  States  was  a  large  one— </p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-nine delegates, including twenty voting and  nine advisory delegates. The Sixth Congress convened under the slogan of “War Against  the  Right  Danger and  the  Rightist  Conciliators.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  period  since  the  February  plenum  of the  Comintern  had been  marked  by the  emergence  of a  clearly  defined  right  opportunist  deviation  in  most  of  the  parties.  They  advanced  the perspective of continuous capitalist recovery and the easing of the class struggle.  In the realm of tactics this meant a continuation of the  old  U nited  front  from  above”  and  a  reliance  on  social reformist trade union leaders. In the U.S,, the right was to find its foremost  exponents  in  the  Lovestone-Pepper  leadership,  which emphasized  the  strength  of  U.S.  capitalism  and  its  ability  to-postpone  the  crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  right  opposition  had  also  begun  to  develop  in  the  CPSU, headed  by Bukharin;  Rykov, chairman of the Council of People’s Commissions;  and  Tomsky,  heading  the  Soviet  Trade  Unions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  group opposed the programs  of the  Stalinist  majority of the Central Committee with  respect to the goals of the new Five Year Plan,  which  called  for  intensified  industrialization,  collectivization, and the drive against the  <i class="calibre4">kulaks</i>. The right deviation in the CPSU  and  in  the  other  parties  of the Comintern had a common source—overestimation  of the  strength  of world  capitalism.  The congress  was  faced  with  the  need  to  answer  these  critics  by</p>

<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS  OF THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">257</p>
<p class="calibre1">deepening  its  analysis  of  the  period  and  by  spelling  out  more clearly  the  policy  flowing from  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  Soviet  Party, the disagreement had come to a head prior to  its plenum of July  1928,  which  adjourned just before the Sixth Congress.  The  differences,  however,  were  hushed  up  by  a  resolution  unanimously  adopted  by  both  groups  which  stated  that there  were  no  differences  in  the  leadership  of  the  CPSU.  The agreement  undoubtedly expressed the desire of the Soviet leadership to keep the congress from becoming an arena for discussion of Soviet  problems  before they had  been  finally thrashed out within their  own  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The delegates, however, were not unaware of the struggle in the Soviet Party.  They gathered in an atmosphere charged with rumor and speculation about differences within the CPSU. The questions in our minds were: Who represented the right danger inthe CPSU, the leading Party of the Cl? What was the role of Bukharin? What had  been  the  outcome  of the  discussions  in  the  plenum  of the CPSU? How would the congress be affected? We did not have long to wait for answers to these questions.  Differences developed over sections of Bukharin’s   <i class="calibre4">Report on the International Situation and</i> <i class="calibre4">Tasks  o f  the  Comintern.1</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  his  report  which  was  distributed  on  July  18,  at  the  second session  of the congress,  Bukharin analyzed the post-World  War I international  situation,  dividing  it  into  three periods.  He defined the first  (1917-1923)  as  one of revolutionary  upsurge;  the second (1924-1927)  as a period  of partial stabilization of capitalism; and the  third  (1928  on)  as  one  of capitalist  reconstruction.  Bukharin made  no  clear  distinction  between  the  second and  third  periods; the  latter  was  simply a continuation  of the second.  According to his characterization,  there was  nothing new at the present time to shake  capitalist  stabilization.  On  the  contrary,  capitalism  was continuing  to  “reconstruct  itself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  this  question  Bukharin  was  challenged  by  his  own  Soviet delegation  which  submitted a series  of twenty amendments to the thesis. These characterized the third period as one in which partial stabilization  was  coming  to  an  end.  Later,  in  his  criticism  of Bukharin’s position, Stalin pointed out the decisive importance of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a><img src="index-266_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">258</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">a correct estimate of the third period.  The question involved here was: MAre we passing through a period of decline of the revolutionary  movement...or  are  we  passing  through  a  period  when  the conditions are maturing for a new revolutionary upsurge, a period of preparation of the working class for future class  battles? It is on this  that  the  tactical  line  of the  Communist  Parties  depends.'’8</p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, all of this was somewhat confusing to us. In his opening report  Bukharin  had  himself  declared  the  right  deviation  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“greatest danger” to the Comintern.  But in his characterization of the  third  period  as  one  of  virtual  capitalist  recovery  he  had adopted the main thesis of the right.  He had also put himself in the awkward  position of being rejected  by his own delegation.  But as Stalin  was  later  to  point  out,  it  was  his  own  fault  for  failing to discuss  his  report  in  advance  with  the  Soviet  delegation,  as  was customary.  Instead  he  distributed  his  report  to  all  delegations simultaneously.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  accordance  with  our  battle  plan  to  expose  the  Pepper-Lovestone  leadership  as the embodiment  of the right deviation in the  American  Party,  our  caucus  took  the  offensive.  Even  before the  discussion  on  Bukharin’s  report  began,  our  minority  had submitted  a  document  entitled  “The  Right  Danger  and  the American  Party.”  It  was  signed  by  J.W.  Johnstone,  M.  Gomez, W.F.  Dunne.  J.P.  Cannon,  W.Z.  Foster,  A.  Bittelman  and  G. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Siskind.10</p>
<p class="calibre1">The document contained a bill of particulars in which we sought to  point  out  that  the  rightist  tendencies  and  mistakes  of  the Lovestone-Pepper  leadership  added  up  to  a  right  line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our attack, however, was hobbled by blemishes in the stateside record of our own eaucus, At that point it would have been hard to discern any principled political differences between the majority or minority.  Nevertheless,  differences  were  developing  on  the  estimation  of the  third  period  and  U.S.  imperialism.11</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pepper  and  Lovestone  exaggerated  the  might  of  U.S.  imperialism  and  spoke  only  of  the  weakness  of  the  U.S.  labor movement and  the class struggle in this country.  But the minority had  also  wavered  on  the  question  of  building  independent trade unions,  the  logical  follow-through  of the  correct  estimate  of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS OF  THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">259</p>
<p class="calibre1">objective  situation  in  terms  of  practical  policy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Negro question, the minority record up to that point had been  no  better  than  that  of the  majority.  This  fact  was  quickly pointed  out by Otto and others.  Both groups had shared the same mistakes.  As  Foster  later observed,  both factions had “traditionally  considered  the  Negro  question  as  that  of a  persecuted  racial minority  of  workers  and  as  basically  a  simple  trade  union matter.” 12  It  was  this  orientation  which  explains  the  Party’s shortcomings  in  this  field  of  work.  But  now,  the  tentative endorsement  by our caucus of the proposed  new line on the Afro-American question strengthened its position vis-a-vis the majority leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  prospects  for  our  minority  were  brightened  by  the  difficulties  of  Lovestone’s  friend  and  mentor,  Bukharin.  Corridor rumors  concerning  his  right-wing  proclivities  were  now  being confirmed by his differences with his own Soviet delegation on the character  of the  third  period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  congress  was  now  settling  down  to  work.  A  number  of commissions were formed to discuss and formulate resolutions on the  main subjects confronting the eongress. Among them were:  1) A Commission on Program, to complete the drafting of a program for the Comintern;  2) one on  the Trade Union  question, to apply the struggle against right opportunism to the trade union field; and 3)  a  commission  on  the  Colonial  Question  which  discussed strategy  and  tactics  of the  liberation  movements  in  the colonies and semi-colonies and the tasks of the Comintern. There were also several commissions on the special problems of individual parties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  major  concern,  however,  was  the  Negro  Commission, which was to take up the problem of the U.S. Blacks and the South African question.  Although set up as an independent commission, in  reality it was a subcommittee of the Colonial Commission. The resolutions formulated by it were included in the final draft of the congress’s thesis on the Revolutionary  Movement in the Colonies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Negro  Commission  was  set  up  on  August  6,  at  the  twenty-third session of the congress.  It was a memorable day. particularly for  us  Black  communists—a  day  to  which  we  all  had  looked forward.  At  last  there  was  to  be  a  full-dress  discussion  on  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">260</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  listened  attentively  as  the  German  comrade  Remmele, chairman of the session, read off on behalf of the presidium the list of members  and officers who would  comprise the commission.  It was  an  impressive  list  and  indicated  the  high  priority  given  the question  by  the  congress.  Thirty-two  delegates,  representing eighteen  countries,  including  the  United  States,  South  Africa, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain,  Turkey,  India,  Palestine  and  Syria  were  members  of the commission.  Impressive  also  were  its  officers:  the  chairman, Ottomar  Kuusinen,  was  a  member  of  the  Cl  Secretariat  and chairman  of  the  Colonial  Commission;  the  vice-chairman  Petrovsky  (Bennett)  was  also  chairman  of  the  Anglo-American Secretariat;  and  the  recording  secretary,  Mikhailov  (Williams), was  a  former  Cl  representative  to  the  American  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">,The  delegates  from  the  U.S.  included  five  Blacks:  myself, Jones  (Otto  Hall),  Farmer  (Roy  Mahoney),  James  Ford  and,  I believe, Harold  Williams; plus two white comrades, Bittelmanand Lovestone.  Others  included  Sidney  Bunting  of  South  Africa; Fokin  and  Nasanov,  representing  the  Young  Communist  International; the Swiss, Humbcrt-Droz, a top Cl official; Heller, from the Communist fraction of the Profmtern; and several members of the Soviet  delegation  to the  congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Participation  in  commission  meetings  was  not  limited  to  its members, however. Among the important figures who spoke in the discussions  were  Manuilsky,  a  Cl  official,  and  the  Ukrainian, Skrypnik,  both  members  of the  Soviet  delegation.  The  hall  was always  crowded  with  interested  observers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  order  of  business  before  the  Commission  was  the Negro question.  It  was introduced  by Petrovsky, who, as I recall, stressed  the  need for a radical turn in the policy of the American Party  with  respect to  its  work  among  Blacks.  He  referred to the Negro  Subcommittee,  set  up  earlier  in  the  year  by  the  Anglo-American  Secretariat,  which  was  given  the  task  of  preparing materials  on  the question  for  the  Sixth  Congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petrovsky described the two positions which emerged from this subcommittee. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a><img src="index-269_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS  OF THE COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">261</p>
<p class="calibre1">One  held  that the weaknesses of the Party’s Negro  work was a result  of an incorrect  line.  The partisans of this position regarded Mucks in the South as an oppressed nation and recommended that I he right of self-determination be raised as an orientation slogan in their  struggle  for  equality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other position,  he said,  held that the question was one of a </p>
<p class="calibre1">'‘racial  minority”  whose  immediate  and  ultimate  demands  were embraced by the slogan of complete economic, social and political equality.  The supporters of this position attributed the weaknesses in  the Party’s Afro-American work to the underestimation of the importance of work among Blacks. This resulted, in turn, from the survivals  of racial prejudices within the ranks of the Party and its leadership.  This  position  did  not  challenge  the  Party’s  line,  but called  for  its  more  energetic  application. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As 1 recall, Petrovsky stated that he himself favored the position on self-determination.  He did  not see it as a negation of the slogan of social equality which, he said, would remain the main slogan for the  Black  masses.  But  in  the  Black  Belt,  where  Blacks are in the majority, in addition to the slogan of equality the Party must raise another  slogan—the right of self-determination.  For  here, equality without the right of Blacks to enforce it is but an empty phrase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time he expressed  agreement with the comrades who contended that the hangovers of racial prejudice in the Party were a  main  obstacle to  the  Party’s  effective  work  among  Blacks.  He stressed the need to fight against the ideology of white chauvinism, a  principle  block  to  the  unity  of Black  and  white  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petrovsky  then  referred  the  comrades  to  the  material  before them.  It  included  the  document  by  Nasanov  and  myself,  summarizing  our  position  in  support  of  the self-determination </p>
<p class="calibre1">thesis.  The  document  contained  a  criticism  of  current  Party activities  and  policies  and  condemned  Pepper’s  May  30th  resolution,  which  had  made  no  reference  to  the  Party’s tasks  in  the South.13  It  also  criticized  the  completely  northern orientation of the  American  Negro  Labor Congress,  as contained  in  the policy statements  of its  leaders,  Lovett  Fort-Whiteman  and  H.V.  Phillips.  Finally, it criticized Lovestone’s characterization of Southern Blacks  as  “reserves of capitalist  reaction.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">262</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other documents presented to the commission were a statement by  Dunne  and  Hathaway  supporting  the  self-determination viewpoint and a document by Sik opposing the proposed new line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">$ik  argued  that  Blacks  were  a  racial  minority  whose  immediate and  ultimate demands  were embraced  by the slogan  of full social equality.14</p>
<p class="calibre1">Later in the discussion,  Pepper submitted a document containing  his  proposals  for  a "Negro  Soviet  Republic"  in  the  South, arguing that Southern Blacks were not just a nation but virtually a colony  within  the  body  of  the  United  States  of  America.15</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  the  American  delegates  who  spoke  in  favor  of  the proposed  new  line  were  Bittelman,  Foster  and  Dunne.  As  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">remember,  all  were self-critical.  Bittelman,  however,  emphasized the dual role of the Black working class envisioned by the new line: first,  its  role  as  a  basic  and  constituent  element of the American working class and, second, its leadership of the national liberation movement  of Black  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  do  not  remember  Lovestonc  speaking.  If he  did,  he did  not openly attack the proposed new line, for that would not have been his  style.  It  was  clear  to  all,  however,  that  he  had  strong reservations.  Sam  Darcy  of the  Young Communist League  was, as  I  remember,  the  only  white  comrade  who openly  opposed  the proposed  new  line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  strongest  opposition  to  the  self-determination  thesis both in  the commission and on the floor of the congress was from the Black comrades James Ford and Otto Hall. In their arguments it  was  evident  that  they  relied  heavily  on  Professor  Sik  and  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">“new"  theory  on  "race  problems."  Up  to  that  point,  neither Nasanov  nor  I  had  paid  much  attention  to  Sik.  But  now  after listening  to  Otto  and  Ford  we  suddenly  realized  the  danger  his theories  posed  to  clarity  on  this  vital  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sik had evidently been working hard on his thesis which he was now  proselytizing  with  almost  evangelic  zeal.  He  had,  if  not  a captive audience, at least a willing one among the Black students at KUTVA  where  he  taught  (of  all  subjects!)  Leninism.  Now suddenly  it  seemed  that  Sik  had  become  cast  in  the role of chief theoretician of the opposition to the proposed new policy; in their</p>

<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS  OF THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">263</p>
<p class="calibre1">speeches Otto and  Ford repeated verbatim many of his arguments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  both  Otto and  Ford  insisted that  U.S.  Negroes were  a  racial  minority  rather  than  an  oppressed  nation  or  an oppressed  national  minority.  (They  used  these  two  latter  terms interchangeably  at  the  time.)  They  ruled  out  all  national  movements among U.S.  Blacks as reactionary. According to Ford, such movements were  led  by the “chauvinistic" Black bourgeoisie who wanted  a  freer  hand  to  exploit  the  Black  masses.  These  movements,  he  argued,  “play  into  the  hands  of  the  bourgeoisie  by arresting  the  revolutionary  class  movement  of  the  Negro masses and  further  widening  the  gulf  between  the  white  and  similar oppressed  groups."16  He  also  averred  that  Blacks  lack  the characteristics  of  a  nation.  There  was  not  the  question  of one nation  oppressing and  exploiting  another  nation. “In the  United States,"  Ford  continued, “we find no economic system separating the two races. The interests of the Negro and white workers are the same.  The  Negro  peasant  and  the white  peasant interests are the same."  The  only  problem,  he  contended,  was  one  of  racial differences  of  the  color  of  the  skin,  barriers  set  up  by  the bourgeoisie.17</p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  sharpened  the argument  and  contended that  Blacks were </p>
<p class="calibre1">“not  developing any characteristics  of a national minority...there exists  no  national  entity  as  such  among...Negroes."  Continuing along the  same  line,  Otto saw no community of interest  between the Black bourgeoisie and the Black toilers, whom, he argued, “are completely separated (from each other) as far as class interests are concerned."  In  sum,  he  contended  that  “historical development has tended to create in him (the Negro) the desire to be considered a  part  of the  American  nation.*1#</p>
<p class="calibre1">What  then  were  the  objectives  of  Black  liberation?  They were, according to Sik, the striving of Blacks for intermingling and amalgamation. I was astounded and dismayed. This seemed to me to  be  a  bourgeois  liberal-assimilationist  position  cloaked  in pseudo-Marxist  rhetoric. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few days  before on the floor of the congress,  Ford and  Otto complained  bitterly  about  the  rampant  white  chauvinism  in  the Party  and  the  widespread  underestimation  of the  significance of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a><img src="index-272_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">264</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Afro-American  work.  Could  they  not  see  that they  were  playing into  the  hands  of the  white chauvinist downgraders of the Black movement? They  had  conceded them their main  premise: that the movement  for  Black  equality  in  itself  had  no  revolutionary potential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sik’s  theory  had  stripped  the  struggle  for  equality  of  all revolutionary content; it involved no radical social change, that is, completion of the land and democratic revolution and securing of political  power  in  the  South.  It  was  just a struggle against  racial ideology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  was  it  possible  for  Otto  and  Ford  and  other  Black comrades  to  fall  into  this  trap?  They  had  separated  racism,  the most salient external  manifestation of Black  oppression,  from its socio-economic  roots,  reducing  the  struggle  for  equality  to  a movement  against  prejudice.  It  was  a  theory  which  even  liberal reformists  could  support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  why did  they  downgrade the  revolutionary  nature  of the Black  struggle  for  equality?  I  could  only  assume  that  it  was  an attempt  on  their  part  to  fit  the  Afro-American  question into the simplistic frame  of “pure proletarian  class struggle." This  theory ruled  out  all  nationalist  movements  as  divisive  and  distracting from  the  struggle  for  socialism.  Lovestonc’s  idea  of  the  Black peasantry  in the South being a “reserve of capitalist reaction” was the  logical  outcome  of this  kind  of thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  was  clear to  me was that our thesis of self-determination had correctly elevated the fight for Black rights to a revolutionary position,  whereas  the  proponents  of Sik’s  theories  attempted  to downgrade the  movement, seeing it as a minor aspect of the class struggle.  Our thesis put the question in the proper perspective: that is,  as  a  struggle  attacking  the  very  foundation  of  American imperialism,  an  integral  part  of  the  struggle  of  the  American working class  as  a  whole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sad  fact  was  that  Otto,  Ford  and  other partisans  of Sik’s theory  seemed  completely  unaware  that  they  had  come  to  a practical  agreement  with  those  white chauvinists  who denied  the revolutionary character of the Black liberation struggle in the false name of socialism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS  OF THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">265</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasanov, sitting beside  me,  undoubtedly had similar thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  muttered  something  in  Russian  that  sounded  like,  “Lord forgive  them,  for they  know  not  what  they do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  an  interval  in  the  Negro  Commission  sessions,  I cornered  Otto  in  the  corridor  and  accused  him  and  Ford  of downgrading the liberation struggle and playing into the hands of the white chauvinist element in the Party, How, I asked him, did he expect  to  fight  those  responsible  for  the  neglect  of work  among Blacks when he accepted their main premise—that the struggle of Blacks was not  of itself revolutionary and that it only becomes so when  they (the  Blacks)  fight  directly  for socialism? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  indignantly  denied  this  and  accused  me  of  allowing the question to be used as a factional football by the Foster group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  conceded  that  they  were not all clear.  But,  I  added  heatedly,  at least  they  had  begun  to  recognize  that  their  position  had  been wrong  and  they  were  trying to  change  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We broke off the discussion;  it was obviously useless to pursue the matter further.  We were both getting emotional. No doubt our relationship had become rather strained as a result of our political differences.  I  was  terribly  saddened  by  this  growing rift  between my  brother  and  me.  True,  1  no  longer  thought  of  him  as  my political  mentor,  but  nevertheless  I  felt  he  was  a  serious  and dedicated  revolutionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What,  I  wondered,  were  the  pressures  that  pushed  Black proletarian  comrades  like  Otto  and  Ford  into  this  position? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foremost  was  their  misguided  but  honest  desire  to  amalgamate Black  labor into  the  general  labor movement.  Nationalism, they felt,  was  a  block  to  labor  unity.  They  failed  to  recognize  the revolutionary element  in Black nationalism.  1  myself had held the same position  only a few months earlier,  but then  I hadn’t studied Leninism  under  Sik. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  remember  running into  Nasanov.  We  walked  down  the  hall arm in arm and he asked me if 1 was going to speak. I said, “I don’t know,  should  I?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing my shyness, he laughed and said, “We’ve got them on the  run.  We’ve  submitted  our  resolution  and  supporting  documents." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a><img src="index-274_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">266</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ve were then accosted  by  Manuilsky whom  I  had met before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  wanted  to  know  if  I  was  the  only  Black  supporting  the self-determination  position.  I  told  him  that  thus  far  I  was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">M</p>
<p class="calibre1">How did that happen?” he asked. That was a question 1 was still trying to  answer  myself.  But  before  I  could  reply he  said, “Oh, I know.  They are  all  good  class-conscious comrades.  But  I understand them.  We Bolsheviks  had the same type of deviation within the party.”  He  turned  away to  greet  somebody  else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And well he  should understand, I  reflected, for Manuilsky had been  one of the leading  Ukrainian Communists referred to in our class on Leninism, who, during the Revolution in the Ukraine, had been  guilty  of the  same  deviation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  been  one  of  those  whom  the  Bolsheviks  had  called </p>
<p class="calibre1">“abstract  Marxists,”  those  unable  to  relate  Marxism  to  the concrete  experience  of  their  own  people.  On  that  occasion  he resisted  the  resolution  of  the  CC  drafted  by  Lenin  which  made necessary  concessions  to  Ukrainian nationalism; these included a softer line on the  <i class="calibre4">kulaks</i> and the establishment of Ukrainian as the national  language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What about  Comrade Pepper’s new slogan for a “Negro Soviet Republic?”  Had he undergone a sudden conversion to the cause of Black nationhood? Was this the same Pepper who had completely ignored  the  South  in  his  May  thesis  and  who  had,  during  the Program  Commission  at  the  Fifth  Congress  of  the  Cl  (1924), asserted  that  Blacks  in  the  US  wanted  nothing  to  do  with  the slogan of self-determination? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sudden shifts  in  position were  not  new  to  Pepper who,  as  we have  seen, was  a man unrestrained  by principles.  Lominadze had branded  Pepper  on  the  floor  of  the  congress  as  a  man  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“inadequate firmness of principle and backbone.  He always agrees with those who are his seniors even if a minute ago he defended an utterly different  viewpoint.”19</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Commission rejected Pepper’s slogan on the grounds that, first,  it  actually  negated  the  principle  of  the  right  of  self-determination by making the Party’s support of it contingent upon the  acceptance  by  Blacks  of  the  Soviet  governmental  form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly*  it was an  opportunist attempt to skip over the interme</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a><img src="index-275_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS  OF THE COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">267</p>
<p class="calibre1">diate  stage  of preparation  and  mobilization  of the  Black  masses around  their immediate  demands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pepper’s  position  was  actually an attempt to  outflank the new position from the “left.” Clearly he sought to grab the spotlight, to upstage the move towards  a new policy.  Perhaps he thought that the left-sounding term “Soviet” would make the new stress on the national  character of the question more palatable to his factional cohorts  of the pure  revolutionary  persuasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto  seemed  to have nibbled on the  bait; at  least  he felt it did not  contradict  his  position.  In  his  previously  quoted  speech  he stated, “There is no objection on our part on (sic) the principle of a Soviet  Republic  for  Negroes  in  America.  The  point  we  are concerned with here is how to organize these Negroes at present on the  basis  of their everyday  needs  for the  revolution.”  20</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this case,  however, Pepper had  overreached  himself,  having jumped  over the  bandwagon  instead  of on  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite Pepper’s defeat in the commission, he still had a card or two  up  his sleeve.  This we were to find  to our surprise and  anger when  we  received  the  October  1928  issue  of   <i class="calibre4">The  Communist. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">official  organ  of  the  CPUS A.  Prominent among the articles was Pepper’s on “American Negro Problems,” which presented his call for a “Negro Soviet  Republic.” But that was not all; the article was also published simultaneously in pamphlet form by the American Party.  Neither  the  article  nor  the  pamphlet  was  labeled  as  a discussion paper, which gave them the appearance of being official statements  of the  new  policy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pepper’s  article  had  originally  appeared  in  the   <i class="calibre4">Communist</i> <i class="calibre4">International, </i>  organ  of  the  Comintern,  as  one  of  a  series  of discussion  articles.21  The  other  articles  were  one  by  Ford  and Patterson (Wilson),22 “The Comintern Programme and the Racial Problem”  by  Sik,  and “The  Negro  Problem  and the Tasks of the CPUS A,”  by  me.«</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of these, Sik’s was the only one to appear in the English edition of  the  magazine.  This  was  because  the  English  edition  had suspended  publication  for  technical  reasons  from  September  to December. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Pepper also sent his article to   <i class="calibre4">The Communist, </i> organ of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">American  Party,  where it appeared in October  1928.  Because the official  resolutions  of  the  congress  were  not  published  until January  of the  following year,  Pepper’s  distorted  version  of the new  line  was  the  first  document  available  to  American  Party members.  The  result  was  considerable  confusion  and  misunderstanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Particularly aggravating was that Pepper filched the basic facts of our  analysis  - national  character,  Black  Belt  territory,  etc.— </p>
<p class="calibre1">distorting them  into  a vulgar  caricature  of our thesis.  This latest piece  of  chicanery  did  nothing  to  enhance  Pepper’s  image  in Moscow where it was already on the wane.  It was, however, well-received  in  the  U.S.  where  he  still  had  considerable  influence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ESSENCE  OF  THE  NEW  LINE</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Cl’s new  line on the Afro-American question was released by the ECCI in two documents. The first was the full resolution of the commission, which addressed itself to the concrete issues raised in the discussion. The second was a summary of the full resolution, worked out in the commission under the direction of Kuusinen, for incorporation  in  the  congress  thesis  on  the  “Revolutionary Movement  in  the  Colonies  and  Semi-Colonies.”24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resolution  rejected  the  assimilationist  race  theories  upon which  the  line  of the  Party  had  been  based.  It defined the  Black movement as “national revolutionary” in character on the grounds that  “the  various  forms  of oppression of Negroes....concentrated mainly  in  the  so-called  ’Black  Belt’  provide the  necessary conditions  for  a  national  revolutionary  movement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stressing  the  agrarian  roots  of  the  problem  it  declared  that Southern  Blacks  “arc....not  reserves  of  capitalist  reaction,”  as Lovestone had contended, but they were on the contrary, “reserves of the revolutionary proletariat” whose “objective position facilitates  their  transformation  into  a  revolutionary  force  under  the leadership  of the  proletariat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  line  committed  the  Party  to  champion  the  Black struggle for “complete and real equality.... for the abolition of all</p>

<p class="calibre1">kinds  of racial,  social,  and  political  inequalities.” It called  for an </p>
<p class="calibre1">“energetic  struggle  against  any  exhibition  of white  chauvinism” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  for  “active resistance  to  lynching.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  the  resolution  stressed  the  need  for  Black revolutionary  workers  to  resist  “petty  bourgeois  nationalist  tendencies” such as Garveyism.  It declared that the industrialization of the South and the growth of the Black proletariat was the “most important  phenomenon  of recent years.” The enlargement of this class,  it  asserted,  offers the possiblity of consistent revolutionary leadership  of the  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  called  upon  the  Party to  “strengthen  its work  among Negro proletarians,” drawing into its ranks the most conscious elements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also to fight for the acceptance of Black workers into unions from  which  they  are  barred,  but  this  fight  did  not  exclude  the organization of separate trade unions when necessary.  It called for the concentration of work in the South  to organize the masses of soil-tillers.  And  finally,  the  new  line  committed  the  Party to put forth  the  slogan  of the right  of self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In those regions of the South in which compact Negro masses are living, it is essential to put forward the slogan of the Right of Self-determination.. .a radical transformation of the Agrarian structure of the Southern States is one of the basic tasks of the revolution. Negro Communists must explain to the Negro workers  and  peasants  that  only  their  close  union  with  the white  proletariat  and joint  struggle  with  them  against  the American  bourgeoisie  can  lead  to  their  liberation  from barbarous  exploitation,  and  that  only the victorious  proletarian  revolution will  completely and permanently solve the agrarian  and  national  question  of  the  Southern  United States  in  the  interests  of the  overwhelming majority of the Negro population  of the country.25</p>
<p class="calibre1">SOUTH  AFRICA</p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  keen  interest as the Commission moved to the next point  on  the  agcnda-South  Africa.  Here  again  it  was  a  fight against the denial of the national liberation movement in the name</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">of socialism,  the same  right  deviation  on  new  turf.  In  the South African  setting,  where  four-fifths  of the  population  were  black colonial  slaves,  the deviation  was  particularly  glaring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  true that in the past  year or so the South  African  Party had intensified its work among the natives, a “turn to the masses* </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the  Simons  noted,  by  1928 there were  1,600 Afriean  members out of a total of 1,750 in the Party. The year before there were only 200  African  members.26</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Party  had  pursued  a  vigorous  policy  in  the  building  of Black trade unions, in conducting strikes, and in fighting the most vicious forms of national oppression—pass laws and the like. The Party’s  official  organ,  77ie   <i class="calibre4">South  African  Worker, </i>  had  been revived  on  a  new  basis.  More  than  half  the  articles  were  now written  in  three  Bantu  languages:  Xhosa,  Zulu  and  Tsotho. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sidney Bunting, leader of the South African Party, had emerged as'a stalwart fighter for Native rights  in  the defense of Thibedi, a framed-up Native  eommunist leader.  As a result about a hundred Natives  had  been  recruited  into  the Party, and two were now on the Cent ral Committee. On the whole, the Party was making a turn toward  the  Native  masses.  But  it  still  lacked  the  theory  which would  enable  it  to  tap  their tremendous  revolutionary potential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  did  most  of the  white  leading  cadre,  Bunting  exhibited  a paternalism  with  respect  to  the  Natives.  This  paternalism  was rooted  in an abiding lack of faith in the revolutionary potential of the  Native  movement.  They saw the  South  African revolution in terms  of the  direct  struggle for socialism.  This  white  leadership, brought  up in the old socialist traditions and comprised mainly of European  immigrants,  had  not yet absorbed  Lenin’s teachings on the  national  and  colonial  questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These shortcomings  had  been brought  sharply to the attention of the Comintern by La Guma. The result was the resolution on the South  African  question  whieh  La  Guma,  Nasanov  and  I  had worked on the previous winter. It recommended that the Party put forward  and  work  for  an  independent  Native  South  African Republic with full and equal rights for ail races as a stage toward a Workers and  Peasants  Republic.  This was to be accompanied by the  slogan  “Return  the  land  to  the  Natives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a><img src="index-279_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS OF THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">271</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resolution  was  not  only  rejected  by  the  Party  leadership, but  they  had  now  sent  a  lily-white  delegation  to  the congress  to fight  for  its  repeal.  The  delegation  consisted  of Sidney  Bunting, Party  chairman,  his  wife  Rebecca,  and  Edward  Roux,  a  young South  Afriean  communist  leader  who  was  then  studying  at Oxford.  Whatever  their  hopes  were  on  arrival  in  Moscow,  they now  seemed  dejected  and  subdued.  Having  sat  through  the discussion on the Afro-American question, they undoubtedly saw the  handwriting on  the  wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  start,  the  South  African  delegation  was  on  the defensive,  having  been  confronted  by  other  delegates  with  the inevitable question:  Where  are the  Natives? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  answer eould  they  give?  It  was  evident  to  all that theirs was  a  mission  on  whieh  Natives eould  not  be trusted, even  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">“brought  up  in  the  old  tradition,**  to  use the  phrase  of  Roux. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We Blacks asked about La Guma and they replied, “Oh, he was here just  a short  while ago  and had  his say.  We felt that the other viewpoint  should  be  represented.**</p>
<p class="calibre1">After eopies of the ECCI  resolution  on  South  Africa had been distributed,  the South  Afriean  delegates took the floor before the entire congress  to challenge the line of the resolution.  The South Afriean revolution, they argued, was a socialist revolution with no intermediate  stage,  an  argument  which  posed  a  sort  of  South African  exeeptionalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The argument  ran that  South Africa was not a eolonial country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bunting then contended that “South Africa is, owing to its climate, what  is called a ‘white man’s country* where whites can and do live not merely  as  planters  and  officials,  but  as  a  whole nation of all classes,  established  there  for  eenturies,  of  Dutch  and  English composition.”27</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bunting’s  statement  came  under  attack  on  the  floor  of  the congress,  notably  by  Bill  Dunne.  Bunting  defended  himself, holding  that  his  description  was  solely  factual  and  was  not  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">“advocacy  of  ‘White  South  Afriea,*  . . .   the  very  view  we have combatted  for the  last  thirteen  years.**28</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, Bunting’s views  liquidated the struggle of the black peasantry  in  South  Africa.  He  declared  that  they  were  “being</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a><img src="index-280_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">272</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">rapidly  proletarianized,”  and  further  that  “the  native  agrarian masses  as such  have not yet shown serious signs of revolt.” Hence the slogan of “Return the land to the Natives ” would antagonize white workers with its implication of a  <i class="calibre4">“black race dictatorship. </i> ”29</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rebecca Bunting spoke in the commission sessions. Addressing herself to the land question,  she denied that the land  belonged to the Bantu in the first place. Both the Bantu from central Africa and the  Afrikaaners  coming  up  from  Capetown  had  forced  the aboriginal Hottentots and Bushmen off their land. Thus, there was no  special  Native  land  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The real question on Rebecca Bunting’s mind, however, was not of land, but of the position of the white minority in a Native South African Republic.  She came right to the point.  Who will guarantee equality for the whites in an  independent  Native  Republic? Their slogan, as you know, is “Drive the whites into the sea.” We listened ter her  in  amazement  and  a  laugh  went  through  the audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat was finally let out of the bag, and a mangy, chauvinistic creature  it  was.  Manuilsky  stepped  forward,  his  eyes  twinkling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Comrade  Bunting  has  raised  a  serious  question,  one  not  to  be sneezed  at.  What  is  to  become  of the  whites?  My answer  to  that would  be  that  if  the  white  Party  members  do  not  raise  and energetically  fight  for  an  independent  Native  Republic, then  <i class="calibre4">kto</i> <i class="calibre4">zrtaet? </i> (Who  knows?) They may well be driven into the seal” That brought  the  house down.30</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  commission  finally  affirmed  the  resolution  for  a  Native South  African  Republic.  It was then passed onto the floor of the congress  where  the  fight  continued  and  our  position  was  eventually  accepted.31</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  REVOLUTIONARY  MOVEMENT IN THE  COLONIES</p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon  the  adjournment  of the Negro  Commission,  many of us moved  into  the  sessions  of the  Colonial  Commission.  We found there no peaceful, harmonious gathering, but acrimonious debate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuusinen’s  report  and  draft  thesis  on  the  Revolutionary  Movement  in  the  Colonies  was  under  sharp  attack.  The  point  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a><img src="index-281_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS  OF THE COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">273</p>
<p class="calibre1">controversy  was  the  nature  and  objective  of imperialist  colonial policy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The draft thesis held that the colonial policy of imperialism was directed  toward  “repressing and retarding”  by all possible means the  free  economic and  cultural  development  of the  colonics  and retaining them as backward, agrarian appendages of the imperialist  metropolitan  countries.  This  policy,  the  draft  thesis  maintained,  is  an  essential  condition  for the super-exploitation  of the colonial masses.  Thus,  it  pointed  out: The  objective  contradiction  between  the  colonial  policy  of world  imperialism and  the  independent  development  of the colonial  peoples  is  by  no  means done away with,  neither in China, nor in India, nor in any other of the colonial and semicolonial  countries;  on  the  contrary,  the contradiction  only becomes  more  acute  and  can  be  overcome  only  by  the victorious revolutionary struggle of the toiling masses in the colonies.32</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly,  the  primary  question  for  the  colonies  was  their liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  opponents  of the draft thesis, on  the other hand, took the view that imperialism had shifted its policy from one of hindering the  economic  development  of  the  colonies  to  one  of promoting industrialization  under  the joint  auspices  of the  imperialists and native  bourgeoisie.  This  was  shown  particularly  in  the  more advanced  colonies  such as  India  and  Indonesia,  they  argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  old  social  democratic  theory  of decolonization.  It implied  that  the main  contradiction  between imperialism and the colonies  was  being  eased;  the  colonial  revolution  was  thereby heing  defused.  The  main  components  of  that  revolution,  the national  liberation  struggle  and  the  agrarian  revolution,  were heing eliminated  through industrialization.  Thus,  the perspective before  the  peoples  of those  colonies  was  not  national liberation, but  rather  a  long-range struggle  for  socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was amazed  to find that leading the attack on the draft thesis was none other than our Comrade Petrovsky.  He who had seemed to  be  such  a  stalwart  warrior  against  the  right  on  the  Afro-American and South African question  had now become the chief</p>

<p class="calibre1">274</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">advocate of the blatantly rightist “decolonization theory.” But that wasn’t all.  He had rallied behind him most of the British delegation in  his  attack  upon  the  draft  thesis.  It  was  quite  a  scandal! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here  was  the  British  Party,  in  the  homeland  of  the  world’s greatest  imperialist power, championing the idea that Britain was taking  the  lead  in decolonizing her empire.  The tragedy was that the  British  delegation  seemed  totally  unaware  of the  chauvinist implication  of their stance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  became  clear  to  us  in  the discussion  that  the  British  Party’s position  with  regard  to  the colonies pre-dated  the congress.  This was merely the first occasion for its full airing. Petrovsky had been Cl  representative  to  Britain  and  had  played  no  small  role in the development  of the “decolonization”  theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The partisans of decolonization were utterly routed both in the commission and on the floor of the congress. Lozovsky, Remmele, Murphy,  Manuilsky, Katayama and Kuusinen all took the floor in rebuttal.  In an early session of the congress,  Katayama pointed to the  “criminal  neglect”  of the  British  Party with regard to  Ireland and India in the past, and of the Dutch and American Parties with regard  to  the  Philippines  and  Indonesia.  “The  mother  countries must correct this inactivity on their part, and give every assistance to  the  revolutionary  movement  in  these  colonial  countries,”  he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 was impressed  by  the speeches of Kuusinen and  Murphy, the sole  Britisher  who  really  spoke out against the position taken by his  delegation.  Murphy  accused  his  comrades  of “presenting  a Menshevik  picture  of  the  colonial  problem  and  drawing  ultraleftist  conclusions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  assailed  the  contention  that  the  British  were  out  to decolonize  India  jointly with the native bourgeoisie.  “The need of the  hour  in  every  colonial  country,”  he  continued,  “is  a  strong independent  Communist  Party which understands how to expose the  bourgeoisie  and  destroy  their  influence  over  the  masses through  the correct  exploitation of the differences  between them and  win  the  masses  in  the  numberless  crises  which  precede  the revolutionary  overthrow  of all  counter-revolutionary  forces.”33</p>

<p class="calibre1">took  the  floor  for  the  concluding  blast.  His  summary,  as  I remember  it,  was  a  two-hour  long  devastating  attack  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“decolonizers.”  He  compared  their  position  with  that  of  the notorious  Austrian  social-imperialist,  Otto  Renner, who  had  put forth the perspective of world  industrialization under capitalism, postponing the world socialist  revolution “till  the proletariat will become the great majority even in the colonies.” Kuusinen pointed out that such views “embellished the ‘progressive’ role of imperialism...as  if  the  colonial  world  were  to  be  decolonized  and industrialized  in  a  peaceful  manner  by  imperialism  itself.”*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuusinen  further  contended  that  “the  development  of  native capital  is  not  being  denied  in  the  thesis.”  But  rather than  there being  an  equal  partnership  in  exploitation  between  the  colonial bourgeoisie and imperialism, “imperialism does in fact restrict the industrialization  of the colonies,  prevent  the full development  of the  productive  forces.”  It  is  under such  conditions  that  the class interests of the national bourgeoisie “demand the industrialization of the country,” and  in as much as the national bourgeoisie stands up  for  its  class  interests,  “for the  economic  independence of the country, for its liberation from the imperialist yoke, then it plays a certain  progressive  role,  while  imperialism  plays  a  substantially reactionary  role.”35</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was a  brilliant and definitive presentation, 1 thought.  Slowly gathering  up  his  papers,  Kuusinen  looked  out  over the audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  comrades,” he said, “industrial  development   <i class="calibre4">is</i> taking place in the colonies, but  <i class="calibre4">very</i> slowly, comrades,  <i class="calibre4">very</i> slowly. Infact, just as  slowly  as  the  bolshcvization  of  the  British  Party  Politburo under  the  leadership  of Comrade  Petrovsky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  then  picked  up  his  papers  and  stepped  down  from  the rostrum.  A  momentary  silence  followed,  then  an  outburst  of laughter  and  prolonged  applause.36</p>
<p class="calibre1">PEPPER  GETS  HIS  LUMPS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  struggle  against  the  Lovestone-Peppcr  leadership  faction sharpened  as  the  congress  progressed.  Their  position  of  overestimating  the  strength  and  stability  of  U.S.  capitalism  and  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">underestimating  the  radicalization  of  the  workers  came  under sharp  attack.  Our  opposition  group  (Bittclman,  Foster,  Dunne, Cannon  and  Johnstone)  came  down  hard  on  Pepper,  taking advantage of his growing unpopularity at the congress. The attack on  the  Lovcstone-Pepper  faction  was  supported  by  leading  and influential  members  of  other  delegations:  notably  Lozovsky, president  of the  Red  International  of Labor  Unions,  Lominadze from  the  Russian  Delegation  and  Hans  Neumann  from  the German  Communist  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a pleasure to see how they zeroed in on Pepper. At last, he was  getting  his  well-deserved  lumps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lozovsky began by criticizing the CC of the CPUS A for having </p>
<p class="calibre1">“instigated  opposition  to  the  decision  of  the  Fourth  RILU </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congress  on  the  question  of  new  unions.”  But  the  thrust  of his attack was not  on the position itself,  but on  the dishonesty of the U*S.  Central Committee which, on its arrival in  Moscow, claimed support  for  the  RILU  Congress  decisions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, every Central Committee has the right to declare its disagreement with decisions adopted  by the RILU, but there must be  the  courage  to  declare  this....You  cannot  change  a  negative attitude...into  a  positive  one  on  the  way  from  New  York  to Moscow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lozovsky reiterated earlier criticism of the Party leadership; its passivity  in  organizing  the  unorganized,  its  incorrect  attitude toward Black workers and toward the AFL. Then he focused in on Pepper, blasting his articles in   <i class="calibre4">The Communist</i> (“America and the Tactics  of the  Cl:  Certain  Basic  Questions  of our Perspective,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">May  1928.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Comrade  Pepper  sees  nothing  but  the  power  of  American capitalism,” he charged, “and discovering America anew although this  discovery was  made  long  ago,  completely  passed  over those vital  points  in  my  articles  on  the  eve  of  the  Fourth  RILU </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congress.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  in  a  concluding  salvo,  Lozovsky  accused  Pepper  of having “frequently  lost  his  bearings in European affairs.,.Today, as you have been able to convince yourselves from his speech here, he  is  all at  sea  in American affairs.  He could  truly  be named: the</p>

<p class="calibre1">muddler  of the  two  hemispheres/’37</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lominadze also  kept  Pepper under constant attack during the congress,  scoring  some  devastating  blows.  He  called  Pepper’s speech  “an  advertisement  for  the  power  of  American  imperialism,”  and  stated  that  if it  were  printed  in  the  paper,  it  could  be mistaken  for a “speech of any of the candidates of the Republican and  Democratic  parties.”38  He  then  blasted  Pepper’s  articles  in <i class="calibre4">The  Communist</i>  which  listed  the  obstacles  to the  growth  of the Party,  According  to  Pepper,  Lomindaze  said,  “everything  is hindering  us,  capitalists  arc  hindering  us  by  exploiting  the workers,  the  existence  of  capitalism  itself  hinders  us,  and  of perspectives  there  arc  none at  all.”39</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the historic congress was drawing to a close, Jack Johnstone read  into  the  minutes  for  our  opposition  caucus  a  statement expressing  our  disagreement  with  the  section  concerning  the United  States  in  Bukharin’s  draft  thesis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among many points made in this statement, the most important were that  Bukharin failed to emphasize the instability of American imperialism  and  recognize  the  contradictions  confronting  it;  he failed to condemn the opportunist errors in Afro-American work and did not “state clearly that the main danger in our Party is from the  Right.”40</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  statement  was  signed  by  Dunne,  Gomez,  Johnstone, Siskind,  Epstein  and  Bittelman;  significant  was  the  fact  that Browder,  Cannon  and  Foster  did  not  sign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  he  basically  agreed  with  the statement  and  opposed Lovestone and Pepper, Browder continued to hold his position of not identifying himself fully with the opposition caucus, Cannon’s reasons for not supporting the statement were unclear at the time, but within a few months, he had become the organizer and leader of the  Trotskyist  movement  in  the  U.S.  1  feel  Foster  was,  at  the time,  still  assessing  the  political  lines  in  the  struggle  against  the right  deviation —and  for  this  reason  did  not  sign  the  document. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Sixth Congress called for a sharpened fight of the working</p>

<p class="calibre1">class and the colonial masses  against  imperialism.  It  set  the stage for an all-out  war  against  the  main obstacle to  the left turn.  The right accommodationists and  their conciliators in all the parties of the C l—all provided ideological ammunition for this struggle. The correctness  of these documents were verified  by  the events of the following decade—world economic crisis, the rise of fascism  and the  outbreak  of World  War  II. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  war  against  the  right  got  into  full  swing  immediately following  the  congress.  In  the  next  few  months  the  Lovestone-Pepper  cohorts  were  to  expand  further  their  right  opportunistic thesis  of American  exceptionalism,  elements  of which  they  were developing  hefore  and  during  the  congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  substance,  the  theory  held  that  while  the  third  period  of growing  capitalist  crisis and  intensification of class struggles was valid for the rest of the world, it did not apply to the United States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In&gt;the U.S., capitalism was on the upgrade and the prospects were for an easing of the class struggle.  An era of industrial expansion lay  ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  few  months  were also to  reveal Lovestone’s ties with the  international  right  conspiracy  led  by  Bukharin.  This  conspiracy,  which  we  had  only  suspected  during  the  congress,  was finally  exposed  at  the  November  1929  joint  meeting  of  the Political  Bureau  and  Presidium  of the Central  Committee of the Communist  Party  of the  Soviet  Union.  From  this  point  on,  the conspiracy  of  the  “Bloc  of Rights  and  Trotskyites”  went  underground to plot the overthrow of socialism in the Soviet Union.  In 1937,  Bukharin was  convicted  as  one  of the  main  leaders of this treasonous  conspiracy  and  was  executed.41</p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  most  positive  and  enduring  contributions  of  the Sixth Congress was the program on the question of U  S.  Blacks. It pointed out that all the objective conditions exist in the Black Belt South  for  a  national  revolutionary  movement  of  Black  people against American imperialism.  It established the essentially agrarian-democratic character of the Black liberation movement there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  conditions  of  modern  imperialist  oppression,  it  could fulfill  itself only by the achievement of democratic land redivision and  the  right  of self-determination  for the Afro-American people</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a><img src="index-287_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTH  CONGRESS  OF THE  COMINTERN</p>
<p class="calibre1">279</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  Black  Belt.  Thus,  the  new  line  brought  the  issue  of Black equality out of the realm of bourgeois humanitarianism.  It was no longer  the  special  property  of  philanthropists  and  professional uplifters who sought to strip the Black struggle of its revolutionary implications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new  position  grounded  the issue of Black liberation firmly in the fight of the American people for full democratic rights and in the  struggle  of the  working  class for  socialism.  The struggle  for equality  is  in  and  of itself a  revolutionary  question,  because  the special  oppression  of  Black  people  is  a  main prop  of imperialist domination  over  the  entire  working  class  and  the  masses  of exploited  American  people.  Therefore,  Blacks  and  the  working class  as  a  whole  are  mutual  allies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fight  of  Blacks  for  national  liberation,  quite  apart  from humanitarian considerations,  must  be supported  as it  is a special feature of the struggle for the emancipation of the whole American working  class.  It  is  the  historic  task  of  American  labor,  as  it advances  on  the  road  toward  socialism,  to  solve the problems  of land  and  freedom  which  the  bourgeois  democratic revolution of the  Civil  War  and  Reconstruction  left  unfinished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  slogan  of  self-determination  is  a  slogan  of  unity.  Its overriding  purpose  was  and  still  is  to  unite  the  white  and  Black exploited  masses,  working  and  oppressed  people of all nationalities,  in  all  three stages  of the revolutionary movement:  from  the day-to-day fight against capital,  through  the revolutionary battle for state  power, to the task of building and consolidating socialist society.  The  new  line  clearly  stated  that  this unity could  be built only  on  the  basis  of  the  struggle  for  complete  equality,  by removing  all  grounds  for  suspicion  and  distrust  and  building mutual confidence and voluntary inter-relations between the white masses  of  the  oppressor  nation  and  the  Black  masses  of  the oppressed  nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This line committed the Communist  Party to an uncompromising  fight among its members and in the ranks of labor generally to burn out the root of the ruling class theories of white chauvinism which depicts  Blacks as innately inferior.  The mobilization of the white workers in the struggle for Black rights is a precondition for</p>

<p class="calibre1">280</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">freeing  the  Black  workers  from  the  stifling  influences  of  petty bourgeois  nationalism  with  its  ideology  of  self-isolation.  Only thus, the program pointed  out, can the historic rift in the ranks of American  labor be breached and a  solid front of white and  Black workers  be presented to the common  enemy,  American imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  course,  weaknesses  were  inevitable  in  this  first  resolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  document  was  open  to  the  interpretation  that  the  emerging Black nation was limited only to the territory of absolute majority and  that  the  slogan  of right  of self-determination  was  primarily dependent on the continued existence of an area of absolute Black majority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  document  should  have  made  clear  that  one  cannot  hold absolutely to the national territorial principle in the application of the  right  of self-determination.47  The very  nature of imperialism qjttacks  and  deforms the characteristics  of nationhood,  imperialism  has, to  a large extent, driven Afro-American people from the rural  areas  to  the  cities  of the  north  and  South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  weakness was  the  underestimation  of the  nationality factor  in  the  struggle  for  equality  and  democratic  rights  in  the north.  Thus,  the program failed  to advance any  slogans  for local autonomy which would guarantee and protect the rights of Blacks in  the  north.  The  need for such a program has been  most  clearly demonstrated  in  recent  years  by the  growth  and  development of the movement  for community control of the schools and police in northern  cities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  on  the  whole,  the  resolution  was  a  strong  one.  Its significance was that it drew a clear line between the revolutionary and  the reformist positions—between the line of effective struggle and  futile  accommodation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The document was not a complete and definite statement,  but a new  departure,  a  revolutionary  turning point  in the treatment  of the  Afro-American  question. </p>
