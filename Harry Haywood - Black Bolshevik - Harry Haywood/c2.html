<div class="block">
<p class="block">On the Negroes this double experience of deliberate and devilish persecution from their own countrymen, coupled with a taste of real democracy and world-old culture, was revolutionizing. They began to hate prejudice and discrimination as they had never hated it before. They began to realize its eternal m eaning and complications... they were filled with a bitter, dogged determination never to give up the fight for Negro equality in America.... A new', radical Negro spirit has been born in France, which leaves us older radicals far behind. Thousands of young Black men have offered their lives for the Lilies of France and they return ready to offer them again for the Sunflowers of Afro-America. </p>
<p class="block" style="text-align: right;">W.E.B. DuBois, June 1919</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1">Despite my bitter encounter with racism in school, I liked Minneapolis. I was impressed by the beauty of this city with its many lakes and surrounding pine forests. The racial climate in 1913 was not as bad as my early experience in school would indicate, either. Blacks seemed to get along well, especially with the Scandinavian nationalities, who constituted the most numerous ethnic grouping in the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon quitting school. I became a part of the small Black community and completely identified with it. I found friends among Black boys and girls of my age group, attended parties, dances, picnics at Lake Minnetonka, and ice skated in the wintertime. Here, as in Omaha, a ghetto had not yet fully formed, though (here were the beginnings of one in the Black community on the north side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Included in the Black community and among my new friends were a relatively large number of mulattos, the progeny of mixed marriages between Scandinavian women and Black men. This phenomenon dated back to the turn of the century. At that time it was the fashion among wealthy white families to import Scandinavian maids. Many of these families had Black male servants—butlers, chauffeurs, etc.—and the small Black population was preponderantly male. The result was a rash of inter-marriages between the Scandinavian maids and the Black male house servants. The interracial couples formed a society called Manasseh which held well-known yearly balls.<sup>2</sup> As a whole the children of this group were a hot-headed lot and seemed even more racially conscious than the rest of us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was in Minneapolis that I too reached a heightened stage of racial awareness. This was hastened, no doubt, by the tragic events in South Omaha and the fact that I was now an adolescent and (here was the problem of girls. I had noticed that it was in the period of pubescence that a Black boy, raised even in communities of relative racial tolerance, was first confronted with the problem of race. It had been so with my brother Otto in Omaha, and now it was so with me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the first year after dropping out of school I worked as a bootblack, barber shop porter, bell hop and busboy, continuing in the last long enough to acquire the rudiments of the waiter’s trade. At the age of sixteen, I got a job as dining car waiter on the Chicago Northwestern Railway. The first run was also my first trip to the big city, where I had four aunts (my Mother’s sisters). All through my childhood my Mother had told stories about her first visit there at the time of the Chicago Exposition. Upon arrival, one of the older waiters on the car, Lon Holliday, took me to see the town. I’m sure he looked forward to showing a young “innocent” the ropes. After a visit to my aunts, he took me to a notorious dive on the Southside. It was the back room of a saloon at Thirty-second and State Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The piano man was playing “boogie woogie” style, popular in those days. The few couples on the floor were “walking the dog,” “balling the jack,” and so on. Then one of the dancers, a woman, called to the pianist, “Oh, Mr. Johnson, please play ‘Those Dirty Motherfuckers.’” He enthusiastically complied and sang a number of verses of the bawdy tune. I almost sank through the floor in embarassment and even amazement. Lon, who was watching, burst out laughing and he said, “Boy, you ain’t seen nothing yet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then took me to the famous “Mecca Flats” on Federal Street, where a rent party was in process. There he introduced me to a young woman, whom he evidently knew, and slipped her some money, saying, “Take care of my young friend here; be sure you get him back on the car in the morning. We leave for Minneapolis at 10:00 A.M.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The railroads were a way to see the country and in the months tkat followed I took advantage of that, working for different lines, on different runs as far west as Seattle. On one run in Montana called the Loop, the dining car shuttled between Great Falls and Butte by way of Helena, stopping at each town overnight. It was known as the“outlaw run” and I soon found out why. It attracted a number of characters wanted by police in other cities, searching for an escape or a temporary hideout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While laying over in Butte one night, our chef murdered the parlor car porter—cut his throat while he was sleeping in the parlor car. They had been feuding for days. I went through the parlor car that morning and was the first to see the ghastly sight. The police came, but the chef had disappeared. My enthusiasm for the job was gone. It might have been me, I thought, for I had had a number of arguments with the chef about my orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I quit and headed back to Minneapolis, arriving there shortly after war broke out in Europe in 1914.1 was sixteen and had been avidly following the news, reading of the invasions of Belgium, France, the Battle of the Marne, etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One day, walking along Hennepin Avenue I saw a Canadian recruiting sergeant. He was wearing the uniform of the Princess Pat Regiment, bright red jacket and black kilt. A handsome fellow, I thought, looking like Bonnie Prince Charlie himself. He noticed me looking at him and asked, “You want to join up with the Princess Pat, my lad? We’ve got a number of Black boys like you in the regiment. You’ll find you’re treated like anyone else up there. We make no difference between Black and white in Canada.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagining myself in the red jacket and black kilt, I said, “Sure, I’ll join.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then looking at me closely, he asked, “How old are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eighteen,” I lied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your parents living?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you’ve got to get their consent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, they’ll agree,” I said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They live in the city?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you come back here tomorrow and bring one of them with you and I’ll sign you up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” I said, but I knew that my parents would never agree. And well it was, too, for I later learned that this regiment was among the first victims of the German mustard gas attack at Ypres, and what was left of them was practically wiped out at bloody Paschendale on the Sommes front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Life in Minneapolis was beginning to bore me. I was anxious to get back to Chicago, “the big city,” so I moved there and stayed with my Aunt Lucy at Forty-third and State. In 1915 my parents, at the urging of my Mother, also moved to Chicago, and 1 then stayed with them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Chicago I got a job as a busboy at the Tip Top Inn, then considered the finest restaurant in town. It was owned by old man Hicronymous, a famous chef, and was noted for its French cuisine and service. In the trade it was taken for granted that if you had been a waiter at the Tip Top Inn you could work anywhere in the country. After a few months I was promoted to waiter and felt that I had perfected my skills. During the next three years I worked at a number of places: the Twentieth Century Limited, the New York Central’s crack train; the Wolverine (Michigan Central); the Sherman House; the old Palmer House; and the Auditorium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During this time in Chicago 1 saw Casey Jones, a Black man and a legendary character known to at least four generations of Black Chicagoans. As 1 remember, he was partially paralyzed, probably from cerebral palsy. He would go through the streets with trained chickens, which he put through various capers, shouting, “Crabs, crabs, I got them!” He had a defect in his speech which he exploited. The audience would literally fall out at his rendering of the popular sentimental ballad, “The Curse of an Aching Heart”:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">You made me what I am today,</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">I hope you're satisfied.</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">You dragged and dragged me down until</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">The heart within me died.</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Although you're not true,</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">May God bless you,</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">That's the curse of an aching heart!</i></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1">Then there was the beloved comedian, String Beans, who often appeared at the old Peking Theater at Thirty-first and State Street. The Dolly Sisters also appeared there; they were very famous at the time. Teenan Jones’s lush night spot was at Thirty-fifth and State Street. Then at the Panama, another night club, I would listen to Mamie Smith sing “Shimmy-sha-Wobble, That’s All,” a very popular song and dance at the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once, when I wanted to go back to Minneapolis to visit, I caught the Pioneer Limited—riding the rods—out of the station on the west side. This was my first experience in hoboing. I rode the rods as far as Beloit, Wisconsin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Beloit I got off, but was afraid to get back on because a yard dick was going around the cars. I stayed there overnight a fairly cold night as I remember. I met a white man, a “professional” hobo, who took me in tow and told me about the trains leaving in the morning. He said we could catch a train that would pull us right into Minneapolis. It was a passenger train, and we could “ride the blinds in,” that is, the space between the two Pullman cars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We rode the blinds, reaching La Crosse, Wisconsin. On the way he warned, “You know, there’s a bad dick up there in La Crosse. We gotta watch out for him.” When the train pulled to a stop in La Crosse both of us hopped off. Other guys were flying out of the train from all sides—from the rods, the blinds, and there were some on top, too. But this notorious yard dick caught us. He was a rough character, and let us know it as he lined us up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, up there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was at the end of the line of about a dozen guys and was the only Black there. I had my hands in my pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take yer hands outta yer pockets!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took my hands out of my pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The engine’s fireman was looking out, watching all of this. He called to the yard dick, “Say, Jim, let me have that young colored boy over there to slide down coal for me into Minneapolis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dick looked at me and scowled, “All right, you, get up there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He shouted to the fireman, “But see that he works!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll see to that; he’ll work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I scrambled on the engine tender and slid coal all the way to Minneapolis, where I got off at the station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among my new friends in Chicago were several members of the Eighth Illinois, Black National Guard Regiment. They would regale me with tall stories of their exploits on the Mexican border in the summer of 1916 when the regiment took part in a “show of force” against the Mexican Revolution. None of us, of course, knew the real issues involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember reading of the exploits of the famous Black Tenth Cavalry Regiment, which was a part of the force sent by General Funston across the border in pursuit of Pancho Villa. They had been ambushed by Villa and a number of them killed. The papers, on that occasion, had been full of accounts of the heroic Black cavalrymen and their valiant white officers. The Eighth, however, had been in the rear near San Antonio, Texas, and saw no action during the abortive campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intrigued by their experiences, I joined the Eighth Regiment in the winter of 1917. I was nineteen. The regiment, officered by Blacks from the colonel on down (many of them veterans of the four Black Regular Army regiments), gave me a feeling of pride. They had a high esprit de corps which emphasized racial solidarity. I didn’t regard it just as a part of a U.S. Army unit, but as some sort of a big social club of fellow race-men. Still, I knew that we would eventually get into the war. That did not bother me; on the contrary, romance, adventure, travel beckoned. I saw possible escape from the inequities and oppression which was the lot of Blacks in the U.S. I was already a Francophile. I had read and heard about the fairness of the French with respect to the race issue. It seems now, as I look back upon it, that patriotism was the least of my motives. I was avidly following all the news of the war and it seemed certain that the U.S. was going to get involved, despite protestations of President Wilson to the contrary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already the press was whipping up war sentiment. Tin Pan Alley joined in with a rash of jingoistic songs: “Don’t Bite the Hand That’s Feeding You,” “Let’s All Be American Now,” ad nauseum. All this left us cold. However, the song that brought tears to my eyes was “Joan of Arc”:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Joan of Arc, Joan of Arc, </i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Do your eyes from the skies see the foe? </i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Can’t you see the drooping Fleur de Lys, </i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Can’t you hear the tears of Normandy? </i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Joan of Arc, Joan of Arc, </i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Let your spirit guide us through. </i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Awake old France to victory! </i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Joan of Arc, we’re calling you. </i></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1">Truly, nothing was sacred to Tin Pan Alley! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4">Lusitania</i> was sunk; the U.S. declared war in April 1917. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our regiment was federalized on July 25, 1917, and in the late summer we were on our way to basic training at Camp Logan, near Houston, Texas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A demagogic promise was widely circulated that things would be better if Blacks fought loyally. For example, there was the statement of President Wilson; “Out of this conflict you must expect nothing less than the enjoyment of full citizenship rights.”<sup>3</sup> This propaganda was immediately belied by the mounting wave of new lynchings in the South, which claimed thirty-eight victims in 1917 and fifty-eight in 1918. Worst of all was the East St. Louis riot in September 1917; at least forty Blacks were massacred in a bloody pogrom that lasted several days.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p class="calibre1">Then there was the mutiny-riot of the Twenty-fourth Infantry in Houston, Texas, where our regiment was to receive its basic training. Company G of our outfit was already in Houston at the time, having been sent on as an advance detachment to prepare the camp for our occupation. It was through them that I learned exactly what had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black soldiers of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, an old Regular Army regiment, had for months been subjected to insults and abuse by Houston police and civilians. The outfit had stationed its military police in Houston, who were, in theory, supposed to cooperate with local police in maintaining law and order among soldiers on leave. Instead, the Black military police found themselves the object of abuse, insults and beatings by local police. This treatment of Black MPs by racist cops was evidently encouraged by the fact that they (the Blacks) were unarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A report of the special on-the-spot investigator for the NAACP published in the <i class="calibre4">Crisis</i>, its organ, reads: </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="block">In deference to the southern feeling against the arming of Negroes and because of the expected cooperation of the City Police Department, members of the provost guard were not armed, thus creating a situation without precedent in the history of this guard. A few carried clubs, but none of them had guns, and most of them were without weapons of any kind. They were supposed to call on white police officers to make arrests. The feeling is strong among the colored people of Houston that this was the real cause of the riot. </p>
<p class="block">On the afternoon of August 23, two policemen, Lee Sparks and Rufe Daniels—the former known to the colored people as a brutal bully... entered the house of a respectable colored woman in an alleged search for a colored fugitive accused of crap-shooting. Failing to find him, they arrested the woman, striking and cursing her and forcing her out into the street only partly clad. While they were waiting for the patrol wagon a crowd gathered about the weeping woman who had become hysterical and was begging to know why she was being arrested. </p>
<p class="block">In this crowd was a colored soldier, Private Edwards. Edwards seems to have questioned the police officers or remonstrated with them. Accounts differ on this point, but they all agree that the officers immediately set upon him and beat him to the ground with the butts of their six-shooters, continuing to beat and kick him while he was on the ground, and arrested him. In the words of Sparks himself: “1 beat that nigger until his heart got right. He was a good nigger when I got through with him.” </p>
<p class="block">Later Corporal Baltimore, a member of the military police, approached the officers and inquired for Edwards, as it was his duty to do. Sparks immediately opened fire and Baltimore, being unarmed, fled... They followed... beat him up, and arrested him. It was this outrage which infuriated the men of the Twenty-fourth Infantry to the point of revolt.<sup>5</sup></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1">When word of this outrage reached the camp, feeling ran high. It was by no means the first incident of the kind that had occurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The white officers, feeling that the men would seek revenge, ordered them disarmed. The arms were stacked in a tent guarded by a sergeant. A group of men killed the sergeant, seized their rifles, and under the leadership of Sergeant Vida Henry, an eighteen-year veteran, marched on Houston in company strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the soldiers left camp their slogan was “On to the Police Station!” They entered town by way of San Felipe Street which ran through the heart of the Black community. The fact that they took this route and avoided the more direct one which lead through a white neighborhood disproved the charge by local newspapers and the police that they were out to shoot up the town and kill all whites. Their target was clearly the Houston cops. On the way to the station they shot every person who looked like a cop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally meeting resistance, a battle ensued which ended with seventeen whites, thirteen of them policemen, killed. The alarm went out and a whole division of white troops, which was stationed in the camp, was sent in to round up the mutineers. Finally cornered, the men threw down their arms and surrendered, with the exception of Sergeant Vida Henry, who committed suicide rather than be taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole battalion of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, including the mutineers, was hurriedly placed aboard a guarded troop train and sent to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, Immediately upon arrival there, those involved were given a drum-head court martial. Thirteen were executed and forty-one others were sentenced to life imprisonment.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p class="calibre1">The bodies of all the executed men were sent home to their families for burial. I remember reading of the funeral of Corporal Baltimore in some little town in Illinois. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our regiment entrained for Camp Logan with our ardor considerably dampened by these events. Indeed, we left Chicago in an angry and apprehensive mood which lasted all the way to Texas. We passed through East St. Louis in the middle of the night. Those of us who were awake were brooding about the massacre of our kinsmen which had recently taken place there. The regiment traveled in three sections, a battalion each, in old style tourist cars (sort of second-class Pullmans). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning we arrived in Jonesboro, Arkansas, our first stop on the other side of the Mason-Dixon line. We were in enemy territory. For many of us it was our first time in the South. Jonesboro was a division point—all three sections of the train pulled up on sidings while the engines were being changed and the cars serviced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a bright, warm and sunny Sunday morning. It seemed like the whole town had turned out at the station platform to see the strange sight of armed Black soldiers. Whites were on one side of the station platform and Blacks on the other. We pulled into the station with the windows open and our 1903 Springfield rifles on the tables in plain view of the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were at our provocative best. We threw kisses at the white girls on the station platform, calling out to them: “Come over here, baby, give me a kiss!” “Look at that pretty redhead over there, ain’t she a beaut!” And so forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A passenger train pulled up beside us on the next track. There, peering out the open window, was a real stereotype of an Arkansas red-neck. The sight of him was provocation enough for Willie Morgan, a huge Black in our company who was originally from Mississippi. Morgan was sitting directly across from the white man. He undoubtedly retained bitter memories of insults and persecutions from the past and quickly took advantage of what was perhaps his first opportunity to bait a cracker in his own habitat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He reached a big ham-like hand through the window, grabbed the fellow’s face and shouted, “What the hell you staring at, you peckerwood motherfucker?” The man pulled back, his hat flew off. Bending down, he recovered it and then moved quickly to the other side of his car, a frightened and puzzled look on his face. Our whole car let out a big roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then a yard man, walking along the side of the car, asked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are you boys going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goin’ to see your momma, you cracker son-of-a-bitch!” came the reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The startled man looked up in amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of us were hungry. We had been given only a couple of apples for breakfast and now noticed that there were a number of shops and stores in the streets behind the station. I believe our first thought was to buy some food. The vestibule guards would not allow us to take our rifles off the cars, so we left them on our seats and proceeded to the stores in groups. As the stores became crowded, and as the storekeepers were busy serving some of our group, others started to snatch up any article in sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cases of Coca-Cola, ginger ale and near-beer went back to the cars. The path to the train was strewn with loot dropped by some of the fellows. In the stores, some bought as others stole—this spontaneously evolved pattern was employed in raids on all stores in Jonesboro and at other train stops along the road to Houston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only serious confrontation that took place that day involved the group I was with. We crowded into a little store and a fellow named Jeffries, one of my squad buddies, approached the storekeeper who was standing behind the counter Putting his money down, he demanded a coke. Whereupon the guy said, “I'll serve you one, but y’all can’t drink it in heah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” Jeffries asked, innocently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cause we don’t serve niggahs heah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as we were about to jump him and wreck the place, Jeffries, a comedian, decided to play it straight. He turned to us and said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now wait, fellahs, let me handle this. What the man is saying is that you don’t know your place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning to the storekeeper he put his money down and with feigned meekness said, “All right, mister, give me a coke. I know my place, I’ll drink it outside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank goodness this nigger’s got some sense,” the storekeeper must have thought as he placed a coke on the counter. Jeffries snatched up the bottle and immediately hit him on the head, knocking him out cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We then proceeded to wreck the place. We took everything in sight. Rushing back to the train, I heard a loud crash—a plate glass window someone had smashed as a parting gift to the niggerhating storekeeper.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to this time we had not seen any of our officers. They had been up front in the first-class Pullmans. Many of them, we suspected, were sleeping off the after effects of the parties held on the eve of our departure. Major Hunt and Captain Hill now appeared and gave orders to the non-coms and the vestibule guards to allow no one else to leave the train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We waved goodbye to the Blacks on the station platform. They looked frightened, sad and cowed. We were leaving, but they had to stay and face the wrath of the local crackers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The train headed to Texarkana, where the scene was repeated though on a smaller scale. In Texarkana the train stopped only a few minutes and we raided one store near the railroad station. I was the last one out, running to the train with a box of pilfered Havana cigars in my hand. Nearing the train, I passed a couple of local whites talking about the raid. One said to the other, “You see all those niggers taking that man’s stuff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I see it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, what are we going to do about it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I reached the train just as it was pulling out, relieved not to have been left behind to find out the answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next stop was Tyler, deep in the heart of Texas, scene of our most serious confrontation. Here we confronted the law in the person of the county sheriff. Tyler seemed to be a larger town than the others. It was a division point and all three sections pulled up on the sidings. As in Jonesboro, a large crowd had gathered at the station; Blacks on one side, whites on the other. Again, with our guns in view, we started flirting with the white women, throwing kisses at them and so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were very hungry. There had been some foul-up in logistics so there wasn’t any food on the train. All we had that day was a couple of sandwiches and some coffee. We piled off the train and headed for the stores, elbowing whites out of the way. We didn’t carry our guns but many of us wore sheathed bayonets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major Hunt finally appeared but he was only able to stop a few of us. By that time most of us were already ransacking the stores in the immediate vicinity of the station. The path back to the station was strewn with bottles of soft drinks, hams, fruits, wrappers from the candy and cigarettes, etc. The major was frantically blowing his whistle and calling the fellows to come back to the cars. Finally we all got back and were eating our pilfered food, drinking our near-beer and soda. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly a large white man stepped forward out of the crowd. He wore a khaki uniform, a Sam Brown belt and a Colt forty-five in his holster. He approached Major Hunt and identified himself as the sheriff. (Or he might have been chief of police.) He said he intended to search the train and recover the stolen goods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The major, a short, heavy-set Black man, said: “No, you don’t. This is a military train. Any searching to be done will be done by our officers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” he said, “I want to accompany you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No you don’t. You won’t set foot on this train.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sheriff hesitated and looked around at the crowd of white and Black. It was clearly a bitter pill for him to swallow, having for the first time in his life to take low to a Black man in front of his white constituents, as well as setting a bad example for the Blacks. He pushed the unarmed major aside and walked forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on you peckerwood son-of-a-bitch!” we hollered from the car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He approached the vestibule of our car where Jimmy Bland, a mean, grey-eyed and light-skinned Black was on guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back! Get back or I'll blow you apart!” Jimmy pushed the sheriff in the belly with the barrel of his rifle. To further impress upon him that the gun was loaded, he threw the bolt and ejected a bullet. The sheriff, who had doubled over from the blow, straightened up, his face ghastly white. He gasped out something to the effect that he was going to report this affair to the government and walked away. We all let out a tremendous roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We arrived in Houston the next day, five days after the mutiny of the Twenty-fourth. We were informed that five dollars would be docked from each man’s pay to cover the damage incurred on the trip down. I believe we all felt that it was a small price to pay for the lift in morale that resulted from our forays on the trip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were greeted by our comrades from Company G of our battalion on arriving at Camp Logan. They had been there at the time of the mutiny-riot and gave us a detailed account of what had happened. We expected to be confronted by the hostile white population, but to our surprise, the confrontation with the Twenty-fourth seemed to have bettered the racial climate of this typical Southern town. Houston in those days was a small city of perhaps 100,000 people, not the metropolis it has now become. The whites, especially the police, had learned that they couldn’t treat all Black people as they had been used to treating the local Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can’t remember a single clash between soldiers and police during our six-month stay in the area. On the contrary, if there were any incidents involving our men, the local cops would immediately call in the military police. There was also a notable improvement in the morale of the local Black population, who were quick to notice the change in attitude of the Houston cops. The cops had obviously learned to fear retaliation by Black soldiers if they committed any acts of brutality and intimidation in the Black community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Houston Blacks were no longer the cowed, intimidated people they had been before the mutiny. They were proud of us and it was clear that our presence made them feel better. A warm and friendly relationship developed between our men and the Black community. The girls were especially proud of us. Local Blacks would point out places where some notorious, nigger-hating cop had been killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See those bullet holes in the telephone pole over there,” they’d say. “That’s where that bad cop, old Pat Grayson, got his.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those Twenty-fourths certainly were sharpshooters!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I occasionally took my laundry to an elderly woman who had known Corporal Baltimore. She told me what a nice young man he was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hear he was hanged,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” I replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears came to her eyes and she cluck-clucked. “He left some of his laundry here; you’re about his size, you want it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I’ll take it,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She handed me several pairs of khaki trousers and some underwear and shirts all washed and starched and insisted that I pay only the cost of the laundry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Camp Logan, our Black Regiment, a part of the Thirty-third Illinois National Guard Division, went into intensive training. We had high esprit de corps. Our officers lost no opportunity to lecture us on the importance of race loyalty and race pride. They went out to disprove the ideas spread by the white brass to the effect that Black soldiers could be good, but only when officered by whites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our solidarity was strengthened when the Army attempted to remove Colonel Charles R. Young from the regiment. Young was the first Black West Point graduate and the highest ranking Black officer in the Regular Army. He wanted to go overseas very badly, but it was quite clear that they did not want a Black officer of his rank over there. He was examined by an Army medical board and found unfit for overseas service. We all knew it was a fraud. It was in all the Black papers and was known by Blacks throughout the country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We men didn’t let our officers down. We were out to show the whites that not only were we as good in everything as they, but better. In Camp Logan, our regiment held division championships in most of the sports: track, boxing, baseball, etc. We had the highest number of marksmen, sharpshooters and expert riflemen. Of course, there was no socializing between Blacks and whites, but it was clear that we had the respect, if not the friendship, of many of the white soldiers in the division. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, despite all the efforts of the command, there was a certain degree of solidarity between Black and white soldiers in our division. In Spartanburg, North Carolina, white soldiers from New York came to the defense of their Black fellows of the Fifteenth New York when the latter were attacked by Southern whites. Many of us felt that in the case of a showdown in town with the local crackerdom, we could get support from some of the white members of our division who happened to be around. At least, we felt they would not side with the crackers against us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The high morale of the regiment, the new tolerance (at least on the part of the local white establishment), the new spirit of Houston Blacks were all displayed during the parade of our division in downtown Houston. About two months before our departure, we received notice from headquarters that the regiment was to participate in a parade. We were to pass in review before Governor Howden of Illinois, our host governor of Texas, high brass from the War Department and other notables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We spent a couple of days getting our clothes and equipment into shape. We washed and starched our khaki uniforms, bleached our canvas leggings snow white, cleaned and polished our rifles and side arms, shined our shoes to a mirror gloss. On the day of the parade, we marched the five miles into town, halting just before we reached the center of the city. We wiped the dust from our rifles and shoes and continued the march. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Executing perfectly the change from squad formation to platoon front, we entered the main square. With our excellent band playing the Illinois March, we passed the reviewing stand with our special rhythmic swagger which only Black troops could affect. We were greeted by a thunderous ovation from the crowds, especially the Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe all of Black Houston turned out that day. The next morning, the <i class="calibre4">Houston Post</i>, a white daily, headlined a story about the parade and declared that “the best looking outfit in the parade was the Negro Eighth Illinois.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given final leave, we bid good-bye to our girls and friends in Houston. After that, security was clamped down and no one was allowed to leave the camp. A few days later, we boarded the train and were on our way to a port of embarkation. We didn’t know where we were headed but suspected it was New York. Instead, five days later, we wound up in Camp Stewart near Newport News, Virginia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Newport News, we barely escaped a serious confrontation with some local crackers and the police. The first batches of our fellows given passes to the town were subjected to the taunts and slurs of the local cops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t you darkies stay in camp? We don’t want you downtown making trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several fights ensued. Some of the men from our regiment were arrested and others literally driven out of town. They returned to the barracks, some of them badly beaten, and told us what had happened. A repetition of the riot of the Twenty-fourth Infantry at Houston was narrowly averted, as a number of us grabbed our guns and were about to head downtown. We were turned back, however, by our officers, who intervened and pleaded with us to return to our barracks. Among them was Lt. Benote Lee, whom we all loved and respected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t play into the hands of these crackers,” he said. “We’ll be leaving any day now. All they want is to get us in trouble on the eve of our departure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How about our guys who were arrested?” we asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry. We’ll get them out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We returned to the barracks and, sure enough, our comrades were returned the next day, escorted by white MPs. We spent the next days on standby orders, apparently waiting for our ship to arrive. After that, all leaves were cancelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was on the same day, I believe, that we first learned that we had been separated from our Thirty-third Illinois Division. Henceforth, we were to be known as the 370th Infantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One morning shortly after this, we looked down into the harbor and saw three big ships. We knew then that we would soon be on our way. The following morning the regiment marched down to the dockside to board ship. Yet another incident occurred at the dock. We lined up in company front facing the harbor and hatted a few yards from the fence which ran the entire length of the dock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing us in front of the fence were several groups of loitering white native males, probably dockworkers. They stared at us as if we were some strange species. Our captain apparently wanted to move the company closer to the fence and gave the command, “Forward march.” But he “forgot” to call “halt.” That was all we needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were still angry about the beating of our comrades in downtown Newport News a few days before. We marched directly into the whites, closing in on them, cursing and cuffing them with fists and rifle butts, kicking and kneeing them; in short, applying the skills of close order combat we had learned during our basic training. Of course, we didn’t want to kill anybody, we just wanted to rough them up a bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were finally stopped by the excited cries of our officers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Halt! Halt!” We withdrew, opening up a path through which our victims ran or limped away. Then at the command of “Attention! Right face!” we marched along the dock in columns of two’s and finally boarded the ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<h3><b>ON TO FRANCE</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p class="calibre1">We sailed for France in early April 1918, on the old USS <i class="calibre4">Washington</i>, a passenger liner converted into a troop ship. I have crossed the Atlantic many times since, but I can truthfully say that I have never experienced rougher seas. Our three ships sailed out of Newport News without escort. Of course, we were worried; there were rumors of German submarines. Our anxiety was relieved when in mid-ocean we picked up two escort vessels, one of which was the battle cruiser <i class="calibre4">Covington</i>. When we reached the war zone, about three days out of Brest, a dozen destroyers took over, circling our ships all the way into port. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took us sixteen days in all to reach Brest, France, where we arrived on April 22. We were so weak on landing that one-half of the regiment fell out while climbing the hill to the old Napoleon Barracks where we were quartered. Immediately upon our arrival, we were put to work cleaning up ourselves and our equipment, notwithstanding our weakened condition. The next morning we passed in review before some U.S. and French big brass. The following day we boarded a train. We crossed the whole of France from east to west and detrained at Granvillars, a village in French Alsace, close to the Swiss frontier. There we found out that we had been brigaded with and were to be an integral part of the French Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason we were separated from the white Americans was, as the white brass put it, “to avoid friction.” But the American command of General Pershing was not satisfied just to separate us; they tried to extend the long arm of Jim Crow to the French. The American Staff Headquarters, through its French mission, tried to make sure that the French understood the status of Blacks in the United States. Their <i class="calibre4">Secret Information Bulletin Concerning Black American Troops</i> is now notorious, though I did not learn of it until after I had returned from France. The Army of Democracy spoke to its French allies: </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="block">It is important for French officers who have been called upon to exercise command over black American troops, or to live in close contact with them, to have an exact idea of the position occupied by Negroes in the United States. The increasing number of Negroes in the United States (about 15,000,000) would create for the white race in the Republic a menace of degeneracy were it not that an impassable gulf has been made between them... </p>
<p class="block">Although a citizen of the United States, the black man is regarded by the white American as an inferior being with whom relations of business or service only are possible. The black is constantly being censured for his want of intelligence and discretion, his lack of civic and professional conscience, and for his tendency toward undue familiarity. </p>
<p class="block">The vices of the Negro are a constant menace to the American who has to repress them sternly. For instance, the black American troops in France have, by themselves, given rise to as many complaints for attempted rape as the rest of the army... </p>
<p class="block">Conclusion:</p>
<p class="block">1. We must prevent the rise of any pronounced degree of intimacy between French officers and black officers. We may be courteous and amiable with these last, but we cannot deal with them on the same plane as with the white American officers without deeply wounding the latter. We must not eat with them, must not shake hands or seek to talk or meet with them outside the requirements of military service. </p>
<p class="block">2. We must not commend too highly the black American troops, particularly in the presence of [white] Americans... </p>
<p class="block">3. Make a point of keeping the native cantonment population from “spoiling” the Negroes. [White] Americans become greatly incensed at any public expression of intimacy between white women with black men... Familiarity on the part of white women with black men is furthermore a source of profound regret to our experienced colonials, who see in it an overweening menace to the prestige of the white race.<sup>7</sup></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently this classic statement of U.S. racism was ineffectual with the French troops and people, even though it was supplemented by wild stories circulated by the white U.S. troops. These included the claim that Blacks had tails like monkeys, which was especially told to women, including those in the brothels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our regiment was not sorry to be incorporated into the French military. In fact, most of us thought it was the best thing that could have happened. The French treated Blacks well—that is, as human beings. There was no Jim Crow. At the time, I thought the French seemed to be free of the virulent U.S. brand of racism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The American Command not only wanted its front line to be all white, it also wanted all regiment commanders (even those under the French) to be white. Consequently, our Black colonel, Franklin A. Dennison; our lieutenant colonel, James H. Johnson; and two of our majors (battalion commanders) were replaced by white officers. Colonel Dennison was sent back to the States, kicked upstairs, given the rank of brigadier general, and placed in command of the Officer Training Camp for Colored Men at Fort Des Moines, Iowa. Although our first reaction was anger, we became reconciled to the shift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our new white colonel, T. A. Roberts, seemed to be warm, paternalistic and deeply concerned about the welfare of his men. He would often make the rounds of the field kitchens, tasting the food and admonishing the cooks about ill-prepared food. He even gave instructions on how the various dishes should be cooked. Naturally, this made a great hit with the men. Our confidence in him was high because we felt that he was a professional soldier who knew his business.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember the day the new colonel took over. The regiment formed in the village square. Colonel Roberts introduced himself. He seemed quite modest. He said that he was honored to be our new commander and that he knew the record of our regiment dating back to 1892 and its exploits during the Spanish-American War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since West Point,” he said, “I have always served with colored troops—the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry.” He then turned to Captain Patton, our Black regiment adjutant. “Captain Patton knows me, he was one of my staff sergeants in the old Tenth Cavalry.” Patton nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colonel smiled and pointed to our top sergeant. “Over there is Mark Thompson. I remember him when he was company clerk in Troop C of the Tenth Cavalry.” He went on to point out a dozen or so officers and non-coms with whom he had served in the Ninth or Tenth Cavalry. “These men will tell you where I stand with respect to the race issue and everything else. We are going into the lines soon and I am sure that the men of this regiment will pile up a record of which your people and the whole of America will be proud.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The process of integration into the French Army was thorough. The American equipment with which we had trained at home was taken away and we were issued French weapons—rifles, carbines, machine guns, automatic rifles, pistols, helmets, gas masks and knapsacks. We were even issued French rations—with the exception of the wine, which our officers apparently felt we could not handle. We got all the wine we wanted anyway from the French troops. They were issued a liter (about a quart) a day and for a few centimes could buy more at the canteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The regiment was completely reorganized along French lines, with a machine gun company to every battalion. My Company E of the Second Battalion was converted into Machine Gun Company No. 2. We entered a six-week period of intensive training under French instructors to master our new weapons. Our main weapon was the old air-cooled Hotchkiss. And we had to master the enemy's gun, the water-cooled Maxim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The period of French training was not an easy one. It was a miserable spring—dark and dreary, and it rained incessantly the whole time we were there. There was a lot of illness... grippe, pneumonia and bronchitis. We lost a number of men, several from our company. The men were in a sullen mood as the time approached for the regiment to move up to the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disgruntlement was often voiced in the now familiar form of “What are we doing over here? Germans ain’t done nothing to us. It’s those crackers we should be fighting.” While we were lined up in the square one day, our captain took the occasion to comment on these sentiments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” he said, “I’ve been hearing all this stuff about guys saying that they weren’t going to fight the Germans. Well, we certainly can’t make you fight if you don’t want to. But I’ll tell you one thing we can and will do is take you up to the front where the Germans are, and you can use your own judgment as to whether you fight them or not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In early June 1918, we entered the trenches at the St. Mihiel Salient near the Swiss frontier as a part of the Tenth Division of the French Army under General Mittelhauser. We were intermingled with the French troops in the Tenth Division so that our officers and men might observe and profit by close association with veteran soldiers. At that time St. Mihiel was a quiet sector. Except for occasional shelling, desultory machine gun and rifle fire, nothing much occurred. We lost no men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was here, however, that we made our first acquaintance with two pests—the rat and the louse—whom thereafter were our inseparable companions for our entire stay at the front. Undoubtedly there were more rats than men; there were hordes of them. Regiments and battalions of rats. They were the largest rats I had ever seen. We soon became tired of killing them; it seemed a wasted effort. Some of the rats became quite bold, even impudent. They seemed to say, “I've got as much right here as you have.” They would walk along, pick up food scraps and cat them right there in front of you! The dark dug-outs were their real havens. When we slept we would keep our heads covered with blankets as protection against rat bites. This may seem flimsy protection, but we were so conditioned that we would awake at any attempt on the part of a rat to bite through the blanket. I have often wondered why there were so few rat bites. Probably the rats felt that it was not worthwhile fooling with live humans when there were so many dead ones around. We soon got used to the rats and learned to live with them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the same with the lice. I woke up lousy after my first sleep in a dug-out. My reaction to the pests took the following progression: first, I was besieged by interminable itching, followed by depression. Then I began to lose appetite and weight, finally becoming quite ill. All this was within a period of a few days. Most of the fellows exhibited the same symptoms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One might say that our illness was mainly psychological, but it was nonetheless real. Since this was a quiet front, I had no difficulty in getting permission to go back to the rear for a few hours. Foolishly, I thought if I could get cleaned up just once, I would feel a lot better. I got some delousing soap, took a bath and washed my clothes. I then returned to the front, stood machine gun watch and then went into the dug-out for a nap. Needless to say, I woke up lousy again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I told my troubles to an old French veteran who had been assigned to my machine gun squad. “Oh, it’s nothing! You must forget all about it,” he said. “You’ll get used to it. I’ve been at the front for nearly four years and I’ve been lousy all the time, except when I was in the hospital or at home on leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took his advice which was all to the good, because I was not to be rid of these pests until six months later during my sojourn in hospitals at Mantes-sur-Seine and Paris after the Armistice. Even then, it was only a temporary respite, for I was reinfected upon rejoining my regiment at the embarkation port of Brest. After a brief stay with the regiment, I was returned to the hospital, again deloused, only to be reinfected again on the hospital ship returning to the States. I parted company with my last louse at the debarkation hospital at Grand Central Palace in New York City. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We remained in the St. Mihiel sector about two weeks. We were then withdrawn and moved into a sector in the Argonne Forest near Verdun, site of the great battles of 1916; we arrived there in late July 1918. We were still brigaded with the Tenth French Division. The area around Verdun was a vast cemetery with a half million crosses of those who had perished in that great holocaust, each bearing the legend, <i class="calibre4">Mort Pour La France</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Argonne at that time was also a quiet sector. But it was here that we suffered our first casualty, Private Robert M. Lee of Chicago. The incident occurred during machine gun target practice. The first and second line trenches ran along parallel hills about a hundred yards apart. The French had set up a make-shift range in the valley in between the trenches. Behind the gun there was a two or three foot rise in the earth, on which a number of us French and Blacks were sitting, chewing the rag, awaiting our turn at the machine gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, there was a short burst of machine gun fire. It was not from our guns. Bullets whizzed over our heads—they seemed to be coming from behind the target. All of us scrambled to get into the communication trench which opened on the valley. Second Lieutenant Binga DesMond, our platoon commander (and the University of Chicago’s great sprinting star), fell from the embankment on top of me. Fortunately, he was not hit. But even with his 180 pounds on my back, I am sure I made that ten or fifteen yards to the communication trench, crawling on my hands and knees, as fast as he could have sprinted the distance! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fire was coming from behind the target. What obviously had happened was that the Germans had cased the position of our guns and had somehow got around behind the target and waited for a pause in our target practice to open fire on us. We never found out how they did it, for none of us knew the exact topography of the place. The French of course knew it, but they had assured us that the place was safe and that they had been using the range for months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were crouched down, panting, in the communication trench for about five minutes after the German guns ceased fire. The French lieutenant (bless his soul) then sent a French gun crew out to get the gun. To our great surprise they also brought back Robert M. Lee. He was quite dead, with bullets right through the heart. He had evidently been hit by the first burst and had fallen forward in front of the embankment. All of us were deeply saddened by the incident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one spoke as we bore his body back to the rear. He was only nineteen, a very sweet fellow, and he was our first casualty. We buried him down in the valley, beside the graves of those fallen at Verdun. The funeral was quite impressive. He was given a hero’s burial, with representatives both from our regiment and our French counterparts. We were especially impressed by the appearance of General Mittelhauser who came down from Division Headquarters to express condolences and appreciation to the Black troops now under his command. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p><h3><b>THE SOISSONS SECTOR</b></h3></p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the fact that we had been in a quiet sector, it was still the front lines with its daily tensions of anticipated attack. In the middle of August, we were pulled out of the Argonne sector and sent to rest behind the lines near Bar-le-Duc. We were deeply pleased by the hospitality and kindness extended to us by the townspeople there. They invited us into their homes and plied us with food and wine. Half-jokingly they told us to come back after the war and we could have our pick of the girls. As we did throughout our stay in France, we deported ourselves well. For pleasures of the flesh, there were a number of legal houses of prostitution, or “houses of pleasure” as they were called by the French. It was with regret that we left that area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By this time, we had become an integral part of the French Army. Along with our French equipment, training and so forth, we had affected the style of the French <i class="calibre4">poilu</i> (doughboy). The flaps of our overcoats were buttoned back in order to give us more leg room while on the march, as was their style. Like the French infantry, we used walking sticks, which helped to ease the burden of our seventy pounds of equipment. French peasants along the road, hearing our strange language and noticing our color, would often mistake us for French colonials. Not Senegalese, who were practically all black but Algerians, Moroccans or Sudanese. We would swing along the road to the tune of our favorite marching song:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">My old mistress promised me.</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Raise a ruckus tonight,</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">When she died she'd set me free.</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Raise a ruckus tonight.</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">She lived so long her head got bald,</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Raise a ruckus tonight.</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">She didn't get to set me free at all.</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Raise a ruckus tonight!</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Oh, come along, little children come along,</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">While the moon is shining bright;</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Get on board on down the river flow,</i></p>
<p class="block"> <i class="calibre4">Gonna’ raise a ruckus tonight.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1">But we had not escaped the long arm of American racism. We were rudely confronted with this reality upon our arrival in a small town on the Compiègne front in the department of Meuse. We entrained here for our next front. The regiment was confronted dramatically with the effects of the racist campaign launched by the American high brass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon entering the town, the regiment was drawn up in battalion formation in the square. Before being assigned to billets, we were informed by the battalion commander that a Black soldier from a labor battalion had been court martialed and hanged in the very square where we were standing. It had happened just a few weeks before our arrival. His crime was the raping of a village girl. His body had been left hanging there for twenty-four hours, as a demonstration of American justice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As a result,” he told us, “you may find the town population hostile. In case this is so,” the major warned, “you are not to be provoked or to take umbrage at any discourtesies, but are to deport yourselves as gentlemen at all times.” In any case, we were to be there only for a few days, during which time we were to remain close to our barracks. Then, in a lowered voice, he muttered, “This is what I have been told to tell you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We kept close to our billets the first day or so, but then gradually ventured further into town. At first, the townsfolk seemed to be aloof, but the coolness was gradually broken down, probably as a result of our correct deportment, especially our attitude towards the children (with whom we always immediately struck up friendships). Friendly relations were finally established with the villagers. When we asked about the hanging they shrugged the matter off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what? That was only one soldier. The others were nice enough.” When asked why they had been so aloof when we first arrived, they said it was the result of the warnings of the white officers. “They didn’t want us to fraternize with the Blacks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continuing the conversation, they seemed puzzled about why the sentence had been so severe and the body barbarously left exposed in the square. <i class="calibre4">“Tres brutale, tres horrible!”</i> they exclaimed. With regard to the girl, “Ah, she had been raped many times before,” one of them jeered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After two weeks of rest, the regiment began to move by stages toward the front lines again. A few days later, we boarded a train consisting of a long line of box-cars. Each car was marked: </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Quarante hommes ou huit chevaux.”</i> (Forty men or eight horses.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last couple of months had been quiet and relatively pleasant, with the exception of the Lee incident and the events just related. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now, we felt, we were going into the thick of it. The premonition was confirmed the very next morning when we woke (that is, those of us who had been able to sleep in such crowded conditions). </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were passing through Château-Thierry. There could be no doubt about it, even though part of the sign had been blown away and only the word “Thierry” remained. The woods around the station and Belleau Woods, a few miles further on, looked like they had been hit by a cyclone: broken and uprooted trees, gaping shell holes, men from the Graves Registration walking around with crosses, Black Pioneers removing ammunition. All were grim reminders of the great battles that had been fought there by American troops only several weeks before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were on the Soissons front, where we became part of the famous Armée Mangia General Mangin (<i class="calibre4">le boucher</i> or the butcher as he was called by the French) was commander of the Tenth Army of France, among whom were a number of shock troops: Chausseurs Alpines, Chausseurs d’Afrique (Algerians and Moroccans), Senegalese riflemen and the Foreign Legion. His army was pivotal in breaking the Hindenburg Line about Soissons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On this front, we were brigaded with the Fifty-ninth French Division, under the command of General Vincendon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We bypassed Thierry and Belleau Woods and detrained at the village of Villers-Cotterêts, the birthplace of Alexandre Dumas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The atmosphere was charged with expectancy. Observation balloons hung like giant sausages on the horizon. Big guns rumbled ominously in the distance. A steady stream of ambulances carrying wounded jammed the roads leading from the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously a big battle was in progress not too far away. But it turned out that we were not going into that sector. We left the village and marched west to Crépy-en-Valois. Turning north through the Compiègne Forest, we reached the Aisne River at a point near Vic-sur-Aisne and continued on to Resson-le-Long where we established our depot company. The march from the railhead to Resson took about three days. It was a forced march and covered about twenty-five kilometers (fifteen miles) a day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was pretty rough after the restless night we had spent on the crowded train. As one of the company wags observed, “One thing ’bout these kilometers, they sho’ will kill you if you keep on meetin’ ’em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our regiment spent six months in the lines in all. We took part in the fifty-nine day drive of Mangin’s Tenth Army which ended on the day of the Armistice. During that period, one or another of our units was always under fire or fighting. Our toughest battles were at the Death Valley Jump Off near the Aisne Canal, the taking of Mont Singes (Monkey Mountain which was later renamed Hill 370 in honor of our regiment), fighting at a railroad embankment northwest of Guilleminet Farm, and the advance into the Hindenburg Line at the Oise-Aisne Triangle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was in the battles on the Hindenburg Line that we met the strongest enemy resistance and sustained most of our losses. The enemy resistance was broken in these battles and they began a general withdrawal, at first orderly and accompanied by brief rearguard actions. Finally, there was the flight to the Belgian frontier, destroying roads and railroads on orders to impede our advance. After Laon, their flight was so precipitous that we had difficulty maintaining contact. We entered many villages which they had left the day before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our outfit was the first allied troops to enter the fortified city of Laon, wresting it from the Germans after four years of war. We were greeted with tremendous elation by the population, who had lived under German occupation the whole of that period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The regiment was highly praised by the French. It won twenty-one Distinguished Service Crosses, sixty-eight Croix de Guerre and one Distinguished Service Medal. In the whole two months’ drive, casualties were 500 killed and wounded—a total of about one-fifth of the regiment. These casualties were light when compared with those of Black regiments on other fronts. For example, the 371st Infantry of drafted men lost 1,065 out of 2,384 men in three days’ fighting during the great September defensive on the Compiègne Front. I believe that the German resistance on these other fronts, east and west of Soissons, was more stubborn than on our front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of our Black regiments were fortunate to have been brigaded with the French. In this respect, the American High Command did us a big favor, unintentionally, I am sure. For as far as we were able to observe, the French made no discrimination in the treatment of Black officers and men, with whom they fraternized freely. They regarded us as brothers-in-arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarly, the French people in the villages in which we stopped or were stationed were uniformly courteous and friendly, and we made many friends. I must say that we were also on our best behavior. I don’t remember a single incident of misbehavior on the part of our men toward French villagers. The latter were quick to notice this and to contrast our gentlemanly deportment with the rudeness of the white Americans. Many of the white soldiers made no effort to hide their disdain for the French (whom they regarded as inferiors) and commonly referred to them as “frogs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even as we fought, we were being stabbed in the back by the American High Command. We were not to learn, however, until our return to the States of the slanderous, racist document issued by the American General Staff Headquarters through its brainwashed French Mission (the <i class="calibre4">Secret Information Concerning Black American Troops</i> referred to earlier). </p>
<p class="calibre1">We learned also that the hanging of the Black soldier on the Compiègne Front was not an isolated incident, but part of a deliberate campaign conducted by higher and lower echelons in the American Command to influence French civilians against Blacks. The campaign focused on the effort to build up the Black rapist scare among them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such was a memorandum issued by headquarters of the Ninety-second Division (a Black division officered largely by whites) on August 21, 1918. Its purpose was to “prevent the presence of colored troops from being a menace to women.” The memorandum read in part:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="block">On account of increasing frequency of the crime of rape, or attempted rape, in this Division, drastic preventive measures have become necessary... Until further notice, there will be a check of all troops of the 92nd Division every hour daily between reveille and 11 P.M., with a written record showing how each check was made, by whom, and the result... the one-mile limit regulation will be strictly enforced at all times, and no passes will be issued except to men of known reliability. </p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1">This was followed the next day by another memorandum saying that the commander-in-chief of the American Expeditionary Forces “would send the 92nd Division back to the States or break it up into labor battalions as unfit to bear arms in France, if efforts to prevent rape were not taken more seriously.”<sup>9</sup></p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, Dr. Robert R. Moton of Tuskegee was sent by President Wilson and the secretary of war to investigate the charges. He found only one case of rape in the whole division of 15,000 men. Two other men who were from labor battalions in the Ninety-second area were convicted. One of these was hanged, and I’m sure that this was the unfortunate soldier whom we saw on the Compègne Front. General headquarters was forced to admit that the crime of rape, as later stated by Moton, “was no more prevalent among coloured soliders than among white, or any other soldiers.”<sup>10</sup></p>
<p class="calibre1">This whole racist smear of Black troops, I was to conclude later, represented but an extension to France of the anti-Black racist campaign then current in the States. It was designed to maintain Black subjugation and prevent its erosion by liberal racial attitudes of the French. Back in the States, the campaign was marked by an upturn of lynchings during the war years, with thirty-eight Black victims in 1917 and half again that number in the following year. Even then, things were working up to the bloody riots of 1919. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast to all of this, the appreciation of the French for Black soldiers from the U.S. was shown by the accolade given by the French division commander, General Vincendon, to our regiment. On December 19, 1918, we were transferred from the French Army back to the American Army. On that day, General Order 4785, directed to the Fifty-ninth Division of the Army of France, was read to the officers and men of the 370th. It commended us for our contributions to France. I remember being struck by the poetry of the language, it was all beautifully French to me:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="block">We at first, in September at Mareuil-sur-Ourcq, admitted your fine appearance under arms, the precision of your review, the suppleness of your evolutions that presented to the eye the appearance of silk unrolling its waves... </p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1">Further on in remembering our dead, the communique read: </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="block">The blood of your comrades who fell on the soil of France, mixed with the blood of our soldiers, renders indissoluble the bonds of affection that unite us.<sup>11</sup></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre1"><h3><b>THE ROAD HOME</b></h3></p>
<p class="calibre1">The road back from Soissons lay through the old battlefields where we had fought a couple of months before. Near Anizy-le-Château there were crosses marking the graves of some of our comrades who had died in the fighting there. We paused before the graves, seeking out those of the comrades we knew. We all had the same thoughts: “What rotten luck that they should die almost in sight of victory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the crosses, there was one marked “Sergeant Theodore Gamelin.” Gamelin hadn’t died in combat. I remember the incident clearly. We were all lined up in some hastily dug trenches that morning, waiting for the “over the top” signal. The cooks had just distributed reserved rations. These consisted of a half-loaf of French bread (not the crispy white kind, but a coarse grayish loaf baked especially for the troops, which we called “war bread”) and a big bar of chocolate. Somehow, Gamelin had missed out on these rations. Jump-off time was drawing near. He looked around and his eyes fixed upon a private named Brown, who was sitting on the firing step, putting his rations in a knapsack. Now, Private Brown was one of those quiet, meek little fellows. He always took low, was never known to fight. But Brown was the type of man, I have observed, who can become dangerous. This is particularly true in a combat situation where one doesn’t know whether one will live five minutes longer. Gamelin, a big bullying type, an amateur boxer and very unpopular with his men, called to Brown:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give me some of that bread, Brown. I didn’t get my rations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, that’s just too bad, sergeant,” Brown responded. “I’m not going to give you any of this bread. It’s not my fault you missed your rations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gamelin, with one hand on his pistol, moved as though he were going to seize the bread. Brown had his rifle lying across his lap. He simply raised it and coolly pulled the trigger. The sergeant fell dead! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The platoon commander heard the commotion and ran to the spot, inquiring about what had happened. The men told him that Gamelin was trying to take Brown’s reserve rations and had made a move toward his pistol. Brown, they said, had shot in self-defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously nothing could be done about Brown in those circumstances. So the lieutenant said, “Consider yourself under arrest, Brown. We will take this matter up after this action.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, Brown was killed a few days later. The memory of this incident was on our minds as we viewed Gamelin’s grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His helmet hung on a cross, which ironically bore the inscription “Sergeant Theodore Gamelin—Mort Pour La France (Died for France), September 1918.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had gone through six months at the front without a scratch or a day of illness. But as we neared Soissons, I began to feel faint and light-headed. By the time we reached the city, I had developed quite a high fever. It was the period of the first great flu epidemic which wreaked havoc among U.S. troops in France. I reported to the infirmary and lined up with a group of about fifty men. The medical sergeant took our temperatures and then tied tags to our coats. I looked at mine and it read “influenza.” We were evacuated to a field hospital near Soissons, where I remained for about five days. After that, we boarded a hospital train and were told that we were going to the big base hospital in Paris. Now, I liked that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had never seen Paris and was most anxious to visit the famed city before going home. There were two of us in the compartment, another soldier from the regiment and myself. I felt a little drowsy, so I told my compartment mate that I was going to take a little nap and to wake me up when the chow came around. I “awoke” five days later in a French hospital at Mantes-sur-Seine, near Paris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had put me off the train as an emergency case just before Paris. I came out of a coma to find a number of strange people around my bed—nurses who were Catholic nuns, doctors and a number of patients. They were all smiling. “Thank God, young man,” said the doctor, “we thought we were going to lose you. You’ve been in a coma for five days, but you’re going to be all right now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where am I? Is this Paris?” I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, this is Mantes-sur-Seine, close to Paris. They had to put you off here as an emergency case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong with me?” I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, you’ve had a little kidney infection and it has affected your heart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That sounds bad,” I said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you’re young and have a remarkable constitution. You’ll pull through all right—you’re out of danger now,” he assured me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remained in the hospital for about a month, receiving the kindest and most solicitous attention from nurses, doctors and patients. All seemed to regard me as their special charge. No one spoke English, but I got along all right. It was like a crash course in French. They told me I had a beautiful accent. They brought in an old lady to talk English with me, but she bored me to death. Really, my French was better than her English. She came once and didn’t return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was feeling much better when the head sister came to me one evening to tell me I was to leave the next morning for Paris and the American hospital at Neuilly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve never been to Paris, have you?” she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” I said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you’ve got a treat coming!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was filled with great expectations. The next morning, after embracing all my fellow patients and exchanging warm goodbyes with the doctor and sisters, the head nurse (or sister) took me out in front of the hospital where an American ambulance was waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hop in, buddy,” said the driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haywood, be sure to write us when you get back to Chicago,” said the sister. “Remember we are your friends and want to know how you are getting along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I promised that I would. As we pulled out, she stood on the road waving a white handkerchief and continued to wave it as long as we were in sight. I never wrote them, but often thought of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris, you wondrous city! I was feeling good that morning as we pulled into the hospital at Neuilly. The hospital was situated on the Avenue Neuilly near the Boulevard de la Grande Armée, only a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe. It was a veritable palace. I was assigned to a ward in which there were only four guys, three Australians and one white American from Wisconsin. They greeted me and gave me a run-down on the situation. They were having a hall seeing Paris, taking in all the events, theaters, race tracks, boxing and girls. I don’t believe that I saw a real sick man in that hospital. There were some of course, but they must have been secluded in some out of sight wards. We were all convalescents in our ward. A couple were recuperating from wounds received at the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you do for money?” I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, we don’t worry about that—just stick around a while and we’ll show you the ropes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under their tutelage, it didn’t take me long to catch on. At that time there were dozens of rich American women, including a number from the social register in Paris. They were under the auspices of the Red Cross and had taken over the hospital and its patients as their special “war duty.” They would organize excursions, get tickets for shows, sports events, etc. Coming to the hospital in relays, they would leave huge boxes of chocolates and other goodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were showered with gifts—Gillette razors, Waterman fountain pens, and even some serviceable wrist watches if you asked for them. They would come in waves. Scarcely had one group left when another would come, leaving the same gifts. The guys had it down perfect. They always left one man on watch in the ward. He was there in case the gals would come in while the others were out and receive all the presents and gifts for them. He would point to the three unoccupied beds (there were only five of us in an eight bed ward) and pretend that their occupants were out in the streets. He would suggest that the presents be left for them, also. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Old Wisconsin Slim was the real genius in all this. He even hung a couple of crosses over the unoccupied beds to give more substance to the fiction that they were occupied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every morning we would gather all our presents, take them to the gate, and sell them for a good price to the French who gathered there to buy them. We would then return to the ward and divide the “swag.” Razors and fountain pens seemed to be rare in France at that time. The going rate for razors was about ten francs ($2) and for Waterman fountain pens even more. All this was carried out under the benign gaze of the hospital authorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Discipline was lax, almost nonexistent. We could stay out for two days at a time. The attitude seemed to be: let the boys have a good time, they deserve it. Besides, it’s essential for their convalescence. When we would get a little money together (about once a week), we would run out to Montmartre and the famous Rue Pigalle, “Pig Alley,” to see the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As an old Francophile, I was also interested in French history and culture. I got a guidebook and spent days walking all over Paris, visiting all the historical places about which I had read, mentally reconstructing the events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time was passing rapidly. I had been in the hospital about two months when an administrator called me into his office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Corporal Hall,” he said. “I hope you've been having a good time in Paris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” I replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s good,” he said, “We’re sending you back to your regiment tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are they?” I asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re in Brest, waiting to embark for the voyage home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning I got on the train at the Gare Ouest and arrived in Brest that evening. In Brest, I strolled around a bit on the waterfront and finally sat down at a sidewalk cafe. I was in no hurry to get back into the old regimental harness. I was about to order a drink when suddenly a big white MP appeared. Glowering at me, he said, “Where’s your pass, soldier?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here it is. I’ve just got back from the hospital in Paris and I’m going to my outfit up on the hill,” I explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He grabbed it, glanced at it and shouted, “Well, get going up that hill right now. You’re not supposed to hang around here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I left without my drink and started climbing the hill to the old Napoleon barracks where we had been eleven months before. It seemed like that had been years ago, so much had been crowded into the brief intervening period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I rejoined my outfit. They were living in tents in what seemed to me like a swamp. The weather was miserable, a steady cold rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mud was ankle deep. I was greeted warmly by my comrades. I don’t think that more than half the old boys of my company were left. The rest were dead, wounded, or ill in hospitals all over France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A couple of bottles of cognac were produced. The guys started reminiscing about what they were going to do when they got home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The news from home was bad. Discrimination and Jim Crow were rampant, worse than before. Blacks were being lynched everywhere. “Now, they want us to go to war with Japan,” observed one of the fellows. (The Hearst newspapers at the time were again raising the specter of the “yellow peril.”)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” someone said, “they won’t get me to fight their yellow peril. If it comes to that, I’ll join the Japs. They are colored.” There was unanimous agreement on that point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I bunked down that night and awoke the next morning with a high fever. I went to the infirmary and again was evacuated to a hospital. I immediately began to worry whether I would be able to return with my outfit. As I was waiting on the side of the road to hitch a ride to the hospital, I heard footsteps behind me. I turned and there was Colonel Roberts, our white commander whom I had not seen for months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I started to spring to my feet and salute, but he motioned me to remain seated. “Corporal, you’re from our regiment, aren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir,” I said, “I’m sick and going to the hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I guess I got the flu.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” he said, “you’re in no condition to walk that distance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He hailed a passing truck and instructed the driver to take me to the hospital. “Take care, son; we’re going home soon. Try to come back with us.” That’s the last time I saw Colonel Roberts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A month later, while in the hospital, I picked up the Paris edition of the <i class="calibre4">Herald Tribune</i>. The headline read: “The 370th Infantry (the old Eighth Illinois) returns and is given hero’s welcome in victory parade down Slate Street.” I felt pretty bad, because I could imagine my old Mother standing there waiting for me to pass by. Since I hadn’t written in months, she would probably assume the worst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had been away from the States for quite a while, in free France so to speak, and I had become less used to the American nigger-hating way of life. But I was thrown abruptly back into reality as soon as I crossed the threshold of the American Army hospital in Brest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seemed to be manned by an all Southern staff: doctors, nurses, etc. All of them spoke with broad Southern accents. I was assigned a bed at one end of the ward. When I looked around, I could see only Blacks were in that end. Whites were at the other end. There were no screens, no Jim Crow signs. The Jim Crow was de facto, but nonetheless real. I also noticed that there was a large space between the Black and white sections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a cursory entrance examination, the doctor seemed to think that I didn’t have the flu, and upon hearing my recent medical history, he decided that it was a relapse of the old illness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had no sooner gotten settled when I heard a nurse bawling out a Black soldier for being so dirty. The poor fellow had just come in from some mud hole like the one in which my regiment was situated, where there was no opportunity to bathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t see any of our white boys that dirty!” she shouted, her eyes flashing indignantly at what she, a white lady, was forced to put up with. For the first time, it occurred to me that our Black regiment had been put in a worse location than the whites. Now, that’s pretty hard stuff for a front-line veteran to take. If I had been ill when I came in, I was really sick now. I could feel my blood pressure and fever mount. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a Black sergeant from my outfit in the same ward. He was a tall, dignified and proud looking man, convalescing from a previous illness. He wasn’t a bed patient and was therefore supposed to make his own bed. This he did, but he never seemed to do it to the satisfaction of the nurse, who kept berating him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make it over, that’s not good enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve already made it, and I’m not going to do it again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t talk back to me,” she shouted. “Make that bed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not going to,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You dare disobey my order?” she yelled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm a front-line soldier and you don’t have to yell at me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned and walked to the office and returned with the ward doctor, a little pip-squeak of a man. In a stentorian voice he said: </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make that bed, soldier,” The sergeant didn’t move. The doctor looked at his watch and said, “I’m giving you two minutes to start making that bed. If you don’t, I’m going to prefer charges against you for disobeying your superior officers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">You could see that the proud sergeant was thinking it over and coming to a decision. I could almost read his mind; it seemed that he was thinking that this wasn’t the time to die. He only had a couple more months to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He finally burst into tears, but he got up and made the bed. I’ve seen this sort of situation before, and I feel almost certain that had there been a loaded gun around, the sergeant might have started shooting. It would have been reported in the news as “Another nigger runs amuck.” All of us, including some of the whites, breathed a sigh of relief at this peaceful culmination of what could have been a dangerous incident. At least the nurse never bothered the sergeant after that. Undoubtedly, she sensed the inherent danger of any further provocation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After my stay in Paris, I was seized periodically by moods of depression. These deepened and became chronic during my stay at the Brest hospital, especially after witnessing such humiliating incidents. I felt that I could never again adjust myself to the conditions of Blacks in the States after the spell of freedom from racism in France. I did not want to go back and my feeling was shared by many Black soldiers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought of remaining in France, getting my discharge there and possibly becoming a French citizen. But I did not know how to go about this. Besides, I was ill, and there was my Mother whom I wanted to see again. Probably, some day, if I got well, I would come back—or so I thought as I lay in the hospital at Brest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the day came. We were discharged from the hospital, given casual’s pay (one month’s pay), which in my case amounted to $33, and boarded the ship for home. There was no change in the Jim Crow pattern. We were merely transferred from a Jim Crow hospital to a Jim Crow hospital ship. We Blacks found ourselves quartered in a separate section of the ship. The segregation, however, did not extend to the mess hall or the lavatories (heads). I guess that would have been too much trouble. But the ship's military command passed up no opportunity to let us know our place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, on the first day out we were given tickets for mess—breakfast, lunch and supper. We were supposed to present them to a checker who stood at the foot of the stairway leading up to the mess hall. A Black soldier who had evidently misplaced his ticket tried to slip by the checker unnoticed, but he was not quick enough. A cracker officer who was standing by the checker hollered: “Hey, Nigger, come back here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The guy kept going and tried to merge into a group of us Blacks who had already passed through. Again the officer shouted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nigger, come back here. You, I mean. I mean the tall one over there. That nigger knows who I’m calling.” The soldier finally turned and walked back. Purple with rage, protected by his bars and white skin, the officer said, “Listen, you Black son of a bitch, where is your ticket?” Clearly, the officer had already gauged his man and concluded that there was no fight in him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’t find it,” said the soldier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, why didn’t you say that in the first place instead of tryin’ to slip through heah? Well, you go on back and try to find it. If you can’t, see the sergeant in charge. Don’t evah try that trick again,” said the officer. His anger seemed to ebb and a glow of self-satisfaction spread across his face. He had done his chore for the day. He had put a nigger in his place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The seas were rough again. It was a small ship, leased from the Japanese. Most of us were seasick. The sailors were having a ball at our expense. When one of us would rush to the rail to vomit, one of them would holler, “A dollar he comes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One night, the ship tilted sharply and a number of us were thrown out of our bunks. The bunks were in tiers and I was in a top one. I got a pretty hard bump. The next morning on deck the sailors were talking loudly among themselves (for our benefit of course). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gee,” said one, “this is the roughest sea I’ve ever seen. This old pile is about to come apart. The Japs leased us the worst ship they had.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It just might be sabotage,” another one suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope we make it, but I’m not so sure,” said another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not being seamen, most of us were taking this seriously. A Black soldier turned to me and said, “You know man, after all I’ve been through, if this ship were to sink now almost in sight of home, I would get off and walk the water like the good Lord.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another voice, that of a white sergeant from Florida who had been rather friendly to us: “You know,” he drawled, “this reminds me of old Sam down home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here it comes, we thought, one of those nigger jokes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was up theah on the gallows with a rope around his neck and the sheriff said, ‘Well Sam, is there anything you want to say before you die?’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘All I got to say sheriff,’ said Sam, ‘this sho’ would be a lesson to me.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voyage proceeded uneventfully, with one exception. The gamblers among us were out to get the soldiers’ casual pay. The law of concentration of money into fewer and fewer hands was in process. This was taking place in one of the endless crap games which started in the Bay of Biscay and wound up at Sandy Hook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I never really gambled, even in the Army with room and board guaranteed. If you were broke, you could always borrow some money. The lender knew you couldn’t run out on him. His only risk was that you might become a casualty. But motivated by nothing more than sheer boredom, I got into the game this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, what good was $33 going to do me? To my surprise, I hit a streak of luck and over a period of a week in and out of the game, I ran my paltry grub stake up to the tremendous sum of $1200. That was the high point, after which time my luck began to peter out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, I left the ship with $500. It was my last gambling venture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That morning, we lined up at the rail as our ship passed Sandy Hook and pulled into New York Harbor. It was my first view of the New York skyline. Overcome with emotion, tears welled up in my eyes. Embarrassed, I looked around and found that I was not alone. The guy next to me was obviously crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our landing was a memorable one. Ship stacks were blasting, foghorns blowing, bells were ringing and fire boats were sending up great sprays of water. Passengers in ferryboats were waving and shouting greetings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon docking, we were met by two reception committees of young women. A white one to receive the white soldiers and a Black one to greet us. This time segregation didn’t bother us at all, we were so pleased to see the pretty Black girls. They drew us aside as we came down the gang plank, ushered us into waiting ambulances, and drove us to Grand Central Palace which had been converted into a debarkation hospital. Leaving us in the lobby, they said goodbye and promised to come back soon and show us around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A woman from the Red Cross took our home addresses to notify our families of our arrival. We were then escorted into a large room and told to strip off our clothes. Leaving them in the room, we then went through the delousing process. We were sprayed with some sort of chemical and washed off under showers. We were then given pajamas and a bathrobe and shown to our Jim Crow ward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day, after a physical examination, we were paid off, receiving all of our back pay. In my case, it was for twelve months, amounting to about $450. This, plus the $500 I had won on the ship, seemed to me a small fortune, the largest amount of money I had ever had in my life. I was, so to speak, chafing at the bit, raring to get out and up to famed Harlem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the ship, I had met a Black sergeant named Patterson, who was from the 369th, the old Fifteenth New York. He had also won a considerable sum in the crap game. He suggested that we team up and go to Harlem together. He said he knew his way around there since that was where he lived before he joined the Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the pay off, we were still without clothes. But a clothing salesman came around to take orders for new uniforms. Patterson and I ordered suits, for which we were measured. In a couple of hours the man was back with two brand new whip cord uniforms with chevrons and service stripes sewed on. We had also ordered shoes, which were promptly delivered. We then sneaked out of the hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After we banked most of our money downtown, we took the subway up to 125th Street and visited several “Buffet Flats” (a current euphemism for a high-class whorehouse), drinking and looking over the girls. Patterson seemed to be an old friend of all the madams. They greeted him like a long lost brother. We finally wound up in one real classy joint where we stayed for four days, playing sultan-in-a-harem with the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We returned to the hospital, expecting to be sharply reprimanded and restricted to quarters, but the doctor on his rounds merely asked, “Where have you boys been?” Before we could answer, he simply said, ”I suggest that you stick around a day or two, we have some tests to make.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From New York, we left for Camp Grant near Rockford, Illinois, where we were demobilized out of the service. I was discharged on April 29, 1919. After a cursory examination, I was pronounced physically fit. “What about my chronic endocarditis and chronic nephritis?” I protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, you’re all right, you’ve overcome it all. You’re young and fit as a fiddle,” the doctor answered me. From Camp Grant I returned home to Chicago to see my parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><h3><b>REUNION WITH OTTO</b></h3></p>
<p class="calibre1">Not too long after my discharge, I came home one evening to find Otto. He had just arrived after mustering out of the service at Camp Grant. We were all happy to see him, especially Mother. He showed us his honorable discharge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know,” he said, “I’m lucky to get this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then told stories about his harrowing experiences in a stevedore battalion in the South and then in France. The main mass of Black draftees had been relegated to these labor units, euphemistically called “service battalions,” “engineers,” “pioneer infantry,” etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless of education or ability, young Blacks were herded indiscriminately into these stevedore outfits and faced the drudgery and hard work with no possibility of promotion beyond the rank of corporal. With few exceptions, the officers were KKK whites, as also were the sergeants. Many of them were plantation riding boss types, especially recruited for these jobs. Southern newspapers openly carried want ads calling for white men who had “experience in handling Negroes.” Black draftees were not only subjected to the drudgery of hard labor, but insults, abuse, and in many cases blows from white officers and sergeants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto told us his worst experience was in Camp Stewart in Newport News, Virginia, where he was stationed during the terribly cold winter of 1917-18. For a considerable period after their arrival, they were forced to live in tents without floors or stoves. In most cases, they had only a blanket, some not even that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New arrivals to the camp were forced to stand around fires outside all night or sleep under trees for partial protection from the weather. For months there were no bathing facilities nor clothing for the men. These conditions were subsequently changed as a result of protests by the men and reports by investigators. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His outfit landed in the port of St. Lazare, France, and during the great advance participated in the all-out effort to keep the front-lines supplied in the “race to Berlin.” They worked from dawn to nightfall unloading supplies, including all kinds of railroad equipment, engines, tractors and bulldozers. They built and repaired roads, warehouses and barracks. Discipline was strict; guys were thrown in the guardhouse on the most flimsy pretexts. A Black soldier seen on the street with a French woman was likely to be arrested by the MPs. “The spirit of St. Lazare,” said one officer, “is the spirit of the South.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, Otto often found himself in the guardhouse as a result of fights, AWOLs, etc. How he escaped general court martial or imprisonment I don’t know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His outfit was finally moved to the American military base at Le Mans, about a hundred miles from Paris. Things were somewhat better there. There were even a few “reliable” Black corporals who were allowed weekend passes to visit Paris. Otto was assigned to mess duty as a cook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he applied for leave, he was refused, however. "Well, I didn’t intend to come this close to Paris without seeing it,” he said, “so I went AWOL.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not see much of it, however, before he was arrested by MPs. I was surprised to learn that he had been in Paris during the period that I was in the hospital in Neuilly. Most of his time in the great city was spent in the Hotel St. Anne, the notorious American military jail run by the sadistic Marine captain, "hard-boiled Smith.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here now, bitter and disillusioned, Otto continued his rebellion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It led him first to the Garvey movement where he served for a brief period as an officer in Garvey’s Black Legion. Then in succession, Wobblies, or Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), the African Blood Brotherhood and finally the Communist Party—joining soon after its unity convention in 1921. After returning from the service, Otto stayed at home only a short time and then moved in with some of his new friends. </p>
