<p class="calibre1">Chapter  22</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Revisionism Takes Command</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time of the April  1956 National Committee meeting, the Party  was  in  the throes  of its  most  serious crisis since  1944.  The meeting itself was historic in that it was the first time that the top Party leadership  had met together since  1951. With the exception of  Gil  Green  and  Henry  Winston  who  were  underground  and Bob Thompson  and  Gus  Hall who were still in jail, the National Committee  was  up  from  underground  and  out  of prison.  Right opportunism, which had been thriving and undergoing continuous growth  in  the fifties, erupted  into a full fledged liquidationist line whose only logical  conclusion would  be the complete destruction of the  Party  as  a  revolutionary  force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fresh  out  of the Atlanta Penitentiary,  Eugene Dennis gave the main  political  report  at this meeting. This one-sided, thoroughly negative report  placed  all the blame for the Party’s mistakes and isolation  upon dogmatism and “left sectarianism.” He called for a </p>
<p class="calibre1">“new look” at our past errors and the development of a mass party of socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  effect  of  this  report  was  to  open  the  floodgates  to  the blatantly  liquidationist  faction  led  by  John  Gates,  editor  of the <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker. </i>  Gates and  his cronies on the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> and in the New York State Committee attacked the CP from all sides with the  express  purpose  of dissolving  the  CP  as  a  Marxist-Leninist vanguard party.  Gates pushed for the abandonment of the Party’s leading role and the development of pressure group politics whose</p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">organizational  form would  be a political action association—very much  like  Browder’s  CPA  of  1944. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gates called for a “critical revaluation” of Marxism-Leninism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If anyone asks me whether I base myself on the principles of Marx and  Lenin,  I  want to be able to answer which of those principles I helieve  in  and  which  I d o   not.”1</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  open  liquidationist  faction  made  skillful  use  of  the confusion  that  resulted  from  Khrushchev’s  anti-Stalin  “revelations.” The secret revelations stunned the American Party and in effect deprived  the  anti-revisionist forces of an ally we had  relied on  in  the  past,2  The  international  communist  movement  had historically lent the weight of its influence and prestige to the left in the  American  Party.  For  example:  the  Third  International’s assistance  in  bringing together the two principle organizations— </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Communist  Party and  the United  Communist  Party to form the Communist  Party USA  in  1921;  Comintern leadership  in  the struggle  against  the  factionalism of the twenties and  Lovestone’s American  exceptionalism;  and  the  Duclos  letter  which  helped initiate  the  struggle  against  Browderism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather than finding a source of support in the Soviet Union, we on  the  left  were  thrown  completely  off  balance  by  the  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">“revelations.” At first we couldn’t believe Khrushchev made such a speech,  thinking  it  must  be  some  imperialist  propaganda  stunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When this initial reaction passed we tended to give the new Soviet leadership  the  benefit  of the  doubt  and  failed  to  grasp  the  full implications  of this  attack  on  Stalin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  liquidationist  right  used  this  as  an  excuse  to  attack proletarian  internationalism  in  general,  calling  for  a  sweeping reevaluation of our line. They bitterly denounced our past history as  one of slavishly clinging to imported doctrines, the bankruptcy of  which  was  now  being  proven.  Under  the  guise  of  “fighting dogmatism”  inherited  from  the  era  of the  “cult  of personality,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Gates crowd  concluded that Leninism was nothing more than Marxism applied to the peculiar, hackward condition of Russia— </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  purely  “Russian  social  phenomenon”—and  therefore  not  applicable in the U.S.  They found  Lenin’s theories  of the bourgeois state  as  an  instrument  of class  rule to  be  particularly  outmoded</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p629"></a><img src="index-629_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">REVISIONISM  TAKES  COMMAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">607</p>
<p class="calibre1">under  U.S.  conditions.  It  was  in  this  spirit  of “reexamination,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">that the entire National Committee—with the exception of Foster and Ed Strong  voted to condemn the use of Soviet troops against the  reactionary  CIA-inspired  counter-revolution  in  Hungary  in October  1956. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally,  1  was  most  interested  in  the  role  that  Ben  Davis played at the April board meeting. We had met earlier in the year, not  long  after  Davis  got  out  of jail.  We  had  had  some  friendly discussions.  He  said  he  wanted  to  get  my  ideas  on  the  developments in the Afro-American question in order to help him prepare for  the  report  he  was  going to  make  at  the  meeting.  Despite the sharp disagreements we had had in the past, I felt then that we were largely  in  agreement.  I  thought  that perhaps his years  in jail  had changed  him,  given  him cause to reevaluate  our past  differences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wc  concluded  this series  of meetings  on  a friendly  basis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  May,  however,  I  learned  it was the same old  Ben—the same sly, ruthless politician, who used his authority and that of Foster to further his own personal power and  influence. In his report, Davis strongly  attacked  our  revolutionary  position,  dropping  completely the right of self-determination. At the National Committee meeting in June he restated this position: “It would seem that the </p>
<p class="calibre1">.slogan  of  self-determination  should  be  abandoned  and  our position otherwise modified  and  brought  up to date.”3 This sharp attack  took  me  by  surprise  because  he  had  given  no  indication whatsoever  in  our  earlier  discussions  of any  major  differences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plans  for  the  Sixteenth  Party  Convention  to  be  held  the following  February  were  being  made  at  this  meeting.  A  draft resolution  was  to  be  prepared  as  soon  as  possible  and  preconvention discussion  and  debate  begun.  But the draft resolution was  not  published  until September  1956,  providing little time for adequate  discussion  and  rebuttal  from  the  opposing  points  of view.  Dennis, who had come under attack from the Gates faction, hud  made  some  amendments  to  his  April  report.  But  the  draft resolution was still more or less a restatement of his position at the April  meeting,  characterizing  “left  sectarianism”  as  the  main dn tiger  in  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I*he draft carried the hallmarks of much of what we know today</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p630"></a><img src="index-630_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">608</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK.  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the liberal and reformist  program of the  CPUSA.  Central to a peaceful,  parliamentary,  constitutional  transition  to  socialism would be the development of an anti-monopoly coalition through </p>
<p class="calibre1">“labor  and  popular”  forces  gaining  “decisive  influence  in  key Democratic  Party  state  organizations  and  even  liberal  Republican  political  movements.”  Thus  would develop the “American Road to Socialism.” The Communist Party would remain on the sidelines  to  “support  and  endorse”  such  progressive  campaigns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  Afro-American  question,  the  right  of self-determination was  completely  omitted  and  the  Party  urged  wholehearted acceptance^  of  the  NAACP  slogan  of  “Free  By  ’63.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Working  class  leadership  and  proletarian  revolution  were entirely  excluded  from  this  document.  The  National  Board voted  in  favor  of  the  resolution,  Foster  and  Davis  voting  a qualified  “yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  October  1956,  Foster,  who  had  been  vacillating  all  along, changed  his  mind  and  voted against  the  resolution.  In an article entitled  “On the  Party Situation,” he outlines the reasons for this change.4  Citing  the  development  of  a  “new  Browderism”  and a  re-emergence  of  American  exceptionalism  in  the  Party,  he attacked  the  attempts  to  openly  liquidate  the  Party,  to  drop Marxism-Leninism from the preamble of the constitution and the failure to see rightism as a cancer to t he Party,  Foster also attacked Dennis’s support  of a “mass  party  of socialism.”5</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  article  for the  first  time  indicated to  the  rank and file the nature  of the  factional  split  then  going on in  the leadership  and stimulated much debate over the genuine criticism of rightism that it raised. In the final analysis, however, the article failed to provide a  firm  basis  for  a  consistent  fight  against  the  right  because  of Foster’s basic unity with  the other factions on the question of the main danger, To Foster ultra-leftism was unquestionably the main danger,  and  as  an  example he cited  the hesitancy with  which the Party took  up the theory  of peaceful transition!  He failed totally to  understand  how  this  very  estimate  of  the  main  danger  had through  the years fostered and nurtured the cancer-like growth of right  opportunism and stifled  the fight against  revisionism in the Party, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p631"></a><img src="index-631_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">REVISIONISM  TAKES  COMMAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">609</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pre-convention  discussions  around  the  draft  were  hot  and heavy.  The  right  contended  that  we  had  to  "seriously”  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">"creatively”  scrutinize  our  past  history,  reevaluate  our  goals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  passed  off  any  criticism  of  their  position  as  “old”  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">"dogmatic,” a refusal to consider fresh approaches or make a new start.  Anyone who attacked them was immediately labeled a "left sectarian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I attended several  meetings of the National Negro Commission as part  of the  pre-convention discussions that fall. The leadership inundated these  meetings with  articles concerning “new data”  on the  Black Belt,  a reevaluation  of the  Black  Belt theory in light  of massive  outmigrations  from  the  deep  South.  I  argued  against these  positions,  that  the  development  and  existence  of  an  oppressed  Black  nation  in  the  South  was  not  merely  a  question  of nose-counting. As 1 later wrote in  <i class="calibre4">For a Revolutionary Position on</i> <i class="calibre4">the  Negro  Question</i>  (1957):</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  approach  blurs  over  the  main  essence  of the  question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with  the outm igrations o f the w ar and post-w ar period, th e  old  m ajority  Black  Belt  area  contains  the  greatest concentration of the Negro people in the U.S. A pproxim ately five  million  Negroes,  nearly  a  third  of  the  entire  Negro population  in the  country (17 m illion) and nearly one-half of the  Negroes  in  the  South  are  still  concentrated  in  the  old Black  Belt  majority  area.  The  fact  is  th at  the  Negro  population in  the  Black  Belt   <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">is  la rg er</b></i> than the total population of 34  countries  who  are  members  of the  UNI6</p>
<p class="calibre1">1  was heartened to sec that I was not alone. A number of Black comrades were opposed to this “reevaluation” by the right and the dropping  of our revolutionary  position.  I  remember particularly Ed  Strong—a stalwart young Black man who spoke very strongly in  defense  of our  position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ed was then a member of the NC and it seemed to me that he had great potential as a leader of the left. As a young seminary student in  Chicago,  he  came  into  the  movement  in  the  early  thirties through  the  National  Youth  Congress.  He  became  national secretary  of  that  organization  and  was  a  founder  and  first executive  secretary  of the  Southern  Negro  Youth  Congress.  He</p>

<p class="calibre1">610</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventually  was  elected  chairman  of the  youth  committee  of the National Negro Congress and, at the time of these discussions, was organizer  of  the  Eastern  Pennsylvania  District  of  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,  Strong  was  never able  to  attend  the  Sixteenth Party Convention,  By that time, he was hospitalized with terminal cancer and died  in  April  1957.  His death was not only a personal loss,  but  a  blow  to  the  left  forces  in  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  discussions  and  the  pre-convention  meetings  in  the districts  served  to  begin  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">consolidation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  genuine </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marxist-Leninist left. For a short time, the left forces were able to build a tentative tactical unity with the Foster-Davis faction which made  some  show  of  wanting  to  Fight  the  openly  liquidationist Gates faction.  This unity, however, was quickly shattered with the Foster-Gates  unity  deal  at  the  New  York  State  pre-convention meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster,  who was  in danger of not  being elected as a delegate to the convention,  made  the  infamous  deal  on “name and  form” of the  Party  in  exchange  for  the  votes  of the  Gates  faction.  While rejecting the dissolution of the Party, a resolution was passed with Gates’s  support which  held  that “any and all proposals to change the  name,  form  or  policies  of  the  Party  can  and  should  be examined  and  discussed  on  their  merits”—thus  leaving the door wide  open  to  future  proposals  from  the  Gates  hunch,7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Widely separated and lacking central  leadership, the left forces nonetheless  continued  to  grow.  We  began  to  gain  ideological clarity through criticizing the opportunism of the Party line.  The pre-convention  meetings  were  the  First  organized  means  on  a national  level  of  examining  the  Party’s  line  since  the  Fifteenth Party Convention in  1950,  Since that time, those who opposed the growing  revisionism  in  the  Party  remained  dispersed  and  confused,  with  no  regular  access  to  any  of  the  Party  machinery through which to air their views. The leadership deliberately kept Marxist-Leninist education to a minimum, as part of theirattempt to  maintain  the  status  quo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  had  systematically  suppressed  dissent  and  all  forms  of inner-Party democracy. Many of the comrades who came together in the  left  caucus  at  the  Sixteenth  Party  Convention  had  locally</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p633"></a><img src="index-633_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">REVISIONISM  TAKES  COMMAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">611</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  individually  raised  struggles  against  revisionism  in  their districts,  but were pretty much unaware of how widespread dissent was  in  the  Party as  a whole.  We were pleasantly surprised to see just  how  many cadre  there were  who  still  had  agreement  on  the basic  principles  of Marxism-Leninism for the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism, for the right of self-determination in the deep  South,  in  support  of  proletarian  internationalism,  and against  the  theory  of peaceful  transition to  socialism  although there  was  some  confusion  on  this  point  as  a  result  of  the Khrushchev revelations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A1 Lannon became the leader of the caucus and one hell of a guy he was  too.  He was a memhcr of the National Committee and the Party leader on the waterfront. I had always liked and admired A1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">as a  man with both feet on the ground,  and with a keen ability to combine theory and practice. He was an old Lenin School man and had  been  a  seaman  for  many  years  before  becoming  a  Party functionary  in  1938. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was  a fearless,  dauntless fighter and  had just recently  been released  from a stint in prison on a Smith Act conviction when he came to the convention. I could see that he was soreas hell with the revisionism  of the leadership,  grabbing  the  microphone at  every possible  opportunity.  Other members of the caucus  included  Joe Dougher,  a  leader  of the anthracite  miners and a member of the NC;  James  Keller,  the  D.O.  of  Chicago;  Armando  Roman,  a Puerto Rican leader on the waterfront in New York and a member of the  New  York  State Committee;  Ted  Allen,  a young guy and former  D.O.  from  West  Virginia;  Angel  Torres,  another waterfront  cadre;  Olga,  a  Venezuelan  comrade  who  had  played  a leading role in the struggles of Latino people in New York City; my wife  Gwen;  and  many  others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  SIXTEENTH  PARTY  CONVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  time  of  the  convention,  February  9-12,  1957,  three distinct factions had emerged on the right. Gates led a blatant and vulgar far right group which was openly anti-Soviet and supported</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p634"></a><img src="index-634_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">612</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">both  the  ideological  and physical liquidation of the Party.  Aside from  Gates,  it  included  men  like  Blake Chamey,  organizational secretary  of New  York;  Joseph Clark,  a   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> reporter; and  Steve  Nelson,  the  D.O.  of Western  Pennsylvania. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The center-right faction was led by Eugene Dennis and included James  Jackson  and  Jack  Stachel.  A  more  covert  and  insidious right  danger,  this faction called  for ideological liquidation of the Party’s vanguard role, but favored the maintenance of some sort of social democratic structure from which to wield power. They also supported  the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The left-center faction was represented by Foster and  his allies: Ben  Davis,  Will  Weinstone and  Boh Thompson,  who was at  the time still in jail. This group perceived a right danger in the Party— </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  other  two  factions—but  still  conceded  that  leftism  was  the main danger. They also had more reservations about openly doing away  with  the  vanguard  party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  three  factions  had  unity  on  the  basic political questions— </p>
<p class="calibre1">support  for  the  theory  of  peaceful,  parliamentary  and  constitutional  transition to  socialism;  a  bourgeois ass inflationist position on the Afro-American question; a view of left sectarianism as the  main danger historically in the Party; and a wavering stand at best,  total  abandonment  at worst,  on the question  of proletarian internationalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  particularly  blatant  in  the  convention’s  refusal  to change  its  position  on  Hungary,  or  to  acknowledge the various criticisms  of the  Party’s  revisionism  as  put  forward  by  Jacques Duclos  and various  Latin American parties.  As  if to proclaim  its independence from Marxism-Leninism, the convention refused to take  a  stand  against  U.S.  intervention  in  Latin  America  and  in support  of independence for  Puerto  Rico. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Sixteenth  Party  Convention  was a  fateful turning point in our  Party’s  history—the  point  from  which  the  Party  turned inevitably and unalterably down the road to revisionism, the point from which the task  of building a new anti-revisionist communist party  became  the  primary  task  of Marxist-Leninists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  discussing  this  historic  event,  I  must  say  something  of the despicable role played by James Jackson.  Earlier he had been sent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p635"></a><img src="index-635_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">REVISIONISM  TAKES  COMMAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">613</p>
<p class="calibre1">South  hy  Eugene  Dennis  and  at  the  time  was  secretary  of  the Southern region of the Party.  It became obvious at the convention that Dennis  had sent  him South for the purpose of presiding over the  liquidation  of the Party in  that  region. Jackson  never did see the need for a vanguard party in the South and openly stated in the pre-convention  discussions  that  the  existing reformist-led  movement  organizes  “the  maximum  political,  economic  and  moral strength of the Black masses and their white allies to bear upon the monopoly  ruling  circles.”8</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson  brought  several  Southern  delegates  with  him  to  the convention,  but  in  the  main,  the  South  was  represented  by proxies—many  of  whom  had  never  been  further  South  than Brooklyn.  He claimed that it was too dangerous to bring Southern delegates  to  the  convention.  I thought this was rather interesting since  we  had  managed  to  bring  such  delegates,  including  Black sharecroppers, in the midst of the worst lynch terror of the thirties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson  actually  used  these  “Southern”  proxies  to  build  a cheering section of his supporters on the floor. The main thrust of the  line  he  pushed  was  to  drop  the  right  of  self-determination, which,  given  the  strength  of  the  left  at  the  convention,  meant avoiding  entirely  a  discussion  of  it!  Jackson  contended that  we could  develop  a  program  of  practical  action  and  deal  with  the political  line at  some  other  time. Together with Carl  Winter and Doxey Wilkerson (a memher of the Gates faction and soon to quit the  Party),  he  wrote  the  main  resolution on  the  Afro-American question—a  thoroughly  reformist  document  that  avoided  any fundamental  discussion  of  line  or  of  the  right  of  self-determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson’s  efforts  to  forestall  discussion  were  given  material support by an arrangement between our caucus and Foster. It was obvious that Gates  was then out to liquidate the Party right there on the spot.  Foster approached us, seeking to block against Gates, and  asked  that  we  support  a  move  to  take  the  question  off the convention agenda, postponing discussion and leaving settlement  of  the  matter  to  a  special  national  conference  on  Afro-American  work  to  be  held  within  sixty  days  of the convention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First  things first. The main question before the convention was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p636"></a><img src="index-636_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">614</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">to “save the Party*’ from the open liquidationism of Gates. Foster argued  that  full  discussion  of the  Black  national  question  would have split  the  conference  wide  open  and  played  directly into  the hands of the Gates faction. At the time, we thought it was the right thing to do and went along with Foster’s deal. But, as we shall see, the  promised  national  conference  on  Afro-American  work  was never  held. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  very  widespread  rumor  about  Ben  Davis  at  the convention and  I  have no doubt that  it’s true. The story goes that someone  in  the  Dennis  faction  asked  Davis  why  he  and  Foster were  going  around  making  deals  with  the  “ultra-lefts.”  Davis replied, “We’ve got to deal with Gates first. When we’ve dealt with him,  then  we can  handle the  left sectarians.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  convention  proceedings,  which strictly  followed  Roberts* </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rules,  were characterized by extreme bureaucratic suppression of the rank and file. Even so, I thought we did pretty well on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lannon  was  the fastest  on  his feet  and got the microphone more than the rest  of us.  The revisionists  have chosen to print precious few  of  his  speeches  in  the  official  transcript  of the  convention proceedings, but there were still a few important remarks included. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  instance:  “On  the  question  of social  democracy,  I  think  the effort  here  is  to  slur  over  and  obscure  the differences  that  exist between  ourselves  and  social  democracy.  We  are  not  discussing here what are the possibilities for a united front—that’s one thing, but  no  united front  is  possible  without  a  clear  understanding  of what our differences are.  United fronts come about not by slurring over  differences  and  hiding  them....I’m  for  a  united  front  with social democracy,  but always  making clear that  we are not social democrats. We have a different program, and united front is based on certain common needs which both agree to while we disagree ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And: “On the question of a mass party of socialism, I think that’s just.,.pie in the sky, and will divert, because I think the pre-condition  to  that  is  centering  all  of  our  work  on  the  rebuilding  and reconstituting  of a  Marxist-Leninist  Communist  Party.”  9</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  able to  speak  only once and used the little time I  had to attack  the  Party’s  line  on the Black national  question.  While the revisionists  thought that the question could  be solved peacefully, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p637"></a><img src="index-637_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">REVISIONISM  TAKES  COMMAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">615</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  more and  more  Blacks  left  the  South  and  became  part  of the industrial working class, I pointed  out that these developments— </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly the proletarianization of Blacks—actually sharpened the fundamental  contradictions  involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  further contended  that  the  Party failed completely to understand the tremendous potential  of the revolt then gathering in the South.  On a world scale, this revolt held particular significance as </p>
<p class="calibre1">“a  national  revolutionary  movement  in  the  heartland  of  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">imperialism, the bulwark of world reaction.” Calling on the Party to  stop  tailing  the  bourgeois  assimilationists,  1  stated  "It  is  not enough  to  greet  these  new,  heroic  struggles  in  the  South,  The embattled  Negro  people  want  our  help,  They  cannot win  alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  need  our  Party,  movement,  and  the  international  working class  movement,  to support  their  struggle.”10</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, such views were drowned in a swamp of revisionism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When all the hoopla was done, the September draft resolution was passed  pretty much intact  with all three of the right wing factions declaring  a  great  victory,  a  new  "unity  of  all  trends,”  and  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">"defeat  against  revisionism.”  Dennis—the arch  conciliationist— </p>
<p class="calibre1">came  out  in  the  strongest  position,  indicating  throughout  the convention  the future course he would  take in fully conceding to the  far  right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dennis  spoke  strongly  in  defense  of  the  rights  of minorities, arguing  in  typical  Dennis  doublespeak  that  "there  is  also  a realization that the more truly democratic we become, the more we need  to  be  a  cohesive  and  united  organization  which guarantees the minority’s right  to dissent at fl//time$.” Indicating the ex tent of his own unity with the line of the Gates faction, he went on to say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Further, I believe that there is much sober thought being given to what  we  mean  by  a  new  and  sounder  relationship  with  other Marxist  parties,  including  those  in  the  socialist  countries.”11</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  clear  from  the  start  that  all  the  talk  of  expanded democracy  and  minority  rights  would  not  be  extended  to  the Marxist-Leninist  left,  which  posed  the  main  threat  to  the  other three factions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gates,  who  was  unsuccessful  in  his  bid  for  a  political  action association, nevertheless came out of the convention fairly strong, </p>

<p class="calibre1">with a number of his supporters on the NC and in key positions in state  organizations.  During the last session of the convention,  he was moved to say that “no matter who lost, the Party has won.”12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster, who had initially expressed the strongest opposition to the line  of the resolution, stated, “I  too,  want to support  this  recommendation.  I  think  it  is  the  best  we  can  do  under  the  circumstances ”13 and then informed  the delegates that he had voted for every  document  in  the  resolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  the  last  Party  convention  that  Foster,  then  seventy-seven  years  old,  was  able to  attend.  A   <i class="calibre4">New  York  Times</i>  article, which  appeared  to  be  based  on  inside  sources,  reported  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">“William Z.  Foster suffered a stinging humiliation yesterday....In the voting to elect a seventeen  member executive committee out of the sixty-six member National Committee, Mr.  Foster was said to have  failed  of election.  He  obtained  a place only when a motion was  adopted  to  expand  the  group  from  seventeen  to  twenty.” 1* </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether or not this report is accurate, Foster’s influence dwindled in  the  following  years  until  his  death  in  the  Soviet  Union  in September  1961. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wrote a  number of articles in this period, among them “The Party Crisis and the Way Out,” 15 which indicated that revisionism had  not  been  defeated  at  the  Sixteenth  Party  Convention, though  “ultra-leftism”  still  remained  the  main  danger  in  the Party.  Foster  suffered  a  stroke  around  the  time  of  its  publication,  but  recuperated  sufficiently  to  write several </p>
<p class="calibre1">other </p>
<p class="calibre1">articles.  In  collaboration  with  Ben  Davis,  he  wrote  “Notes  on the Negro Question,”16 which supported the Party’s assimilationist line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  the  most  controversial  was  a  letter  Foster  wrote  personally to Chairman  Mao in which he praised the progress China had  made  in  the  struggle  to  build  socialism  and  discussed the  situation  in  the  U.S.  and  the  world.17  He  received  a  warm response from  Chairman  Mao,  who thanked  Foster for his letter and  said,  “Allow  me,  on  behalf  of  the  Communist  Party  of China and the Chinese people,  to extend hearty greetings to you, glorious  fighter  and  leader  of  the  American  working  class, and  wish  you  an  early  recovery.”18  The  letter  had  been  sent  in</p>

<p class="calibre1">December  1958,  without  the approval  of the Party’s Secretariat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They would  have liked to have overlooked the matter entirely, hut were unable to do so when Foster’s letter and Mao’s response were published  in the  <i class="calibre4">New  York  Times.19</i> The Party was finally forced to  publish  the  exchange  in  the  March  1959   <i class="calibre4">Political Affairs</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  so-called  “unity  of  all  trends”  reached  at  the  Sixteenth Party  Convention  represented  a  compromise  on  fundamental questions and principles, arriving at a formula which legalized the open  liquidationist  Gates  faction  within the Party  and stifled the necessary ideological  struggle against revisionism. Thus, although the  Party  avoided  an  open  split,  it  was  saddled  with  a  conciliationist line in a period when ideological confusion was rampant in the ranks.  The Sixteenth Party Convention was characterized  by the total  abandonment  of revolutionary  line and principle on all questions  in favor of a sham unity of the right wing, with each of the three  right  factions  scrambling for  position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  gallop  to  the  right  under  the  guise  of  “unity”  followed the convention, with Dennis  putting into practice the thoroughly revisionist program adopted there.  The liquidation of the Party as a  Marxist-Leninist  vanguard  was  further  intensified  as  Dennis made  repeated  concessions  to  the  open  liquidators.  In  an  effort to  keep  peace  with  the  Gates  faction,  “democracy”  and  public criticism  of  the  Party  was  greatly  expanded.  “Freedom  of criticism”  in  this  case  meant  the  freedom  to  further  hasten  the conversion of a communist party into a social democratic party of reforms,  the  freedom to  counterpose  bourgeois  theories  to communist  theories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the  leadership  cried  “unity  of all  trends,”  they actually meant  the  unprincipled  unity  of  the  three  right  factions  in opposition  to  the  Marxist-Leninists.  We  in  the  left  attacked this  phony  unity  at  the  reconvened  district  conventions  and played  a  major  role  in  upsetting  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“unity  slates”  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  State,  Brooklyn and  Manhattan  County conventions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, we were unable to prevent the Davis-Charney unity deal at  the  New  York  State  Convention.  Ben  Davis  became  state chairman,  while  Charney,  a  Gates  man,  became executive </p>
<p class="calibre1">secretary. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The</i>  tactics  of  three  groups—the  open  liquidators,  the  right-center  and  the  “left”  conciliators-..were  very  similar.  They  kept trying  to  forestall  any  kind  of  meaningful  discussion.  The revisionists  continued their effort to separate a program for mass work  from  any  basic,  fundamental  discussion  of  line.  Ben Davis  and  others  ushered  in  the  demagogic  slogan  of  “let’s get  going.”  “The  party  membership  is  sick  and  tired  of internal strife  and  bickering  over  nebulous  abstractions,”  said  Davis  in the   <i class="calibre4">Party  Voice.20</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">1  made  a  speech  at  the  reconvened  convention  in  Harlem, fighting  for  restoration  of  our  revolutionary  position  on  the Afro-American  question  and  an  end  to  tailing  after  the  leadership  of  the  NAACP.  Davis  immediately  attacked  me.  “Left  to Harry  here,  he and  me would  be left alone fighting it down to the ropes.  We  can’t afford  that,  we gotta  get to  work!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following the state conventions, the Lannon forces were strong enough  to be elected to a number of posts on the New York State Committee  and  were  well represented  on the Manhattan County Committee.  Gwen  was  a  section leader in Brooklyn, and we had actual  leadership in two vital concentrations—the waterfront and - </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harlem  and  lower  Harlem.  Our  strength was considerable when one  takes  into  account  the  fact  that  the  New  York  district comprised  over  half the  membership  of the  Party  at  that  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  promised  national  conference  on the  Negro  question was stalled,  postponed  and inevitahly never held.  Many of our Black cadres resigned or were driven out by the revisionist bureaucracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dues  payments  and  club  attendance  dropped,  <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i> circulation  was  down  to  5,000  daily  and  10,000  on  Sunday.21</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  becoming  more  and  more  evident  that  the  leadership actually  had  a  plan  to  drive  the  left  out  of  the  Party  through hureaucratic  suppression  and  harassment.  James Jackson acting as  Dennis’s  lieutenant  personally supervised a campaign to  drive militant  Blacks  out  of  the  Party.  It  was  clear  to  us  that  the leadership would  <i class="calibre4">never</i> hold a national conference on work among Blacks  while  there  were  still  cadres  left  to  fight  for  the  revolutionary  line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of growing pressure from below, however, they were</p>

<p class="calibre1">REVISIONISM  TAKES COMMAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">619</p>
<p class="calibre1">forced to sponsor a few local conferences. This was done with the expressed  purpose  of holding down  dissent,  while  continuing to postpone any fundamental  discussion  of our  line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  remember one conference in New York where the revisionists packed  the  meeting with white trade  union  cadres,  many of them right  wingers  and  covert  white  chauvinists,  who at a signal from Davis or Jackson would begin chanting, “Get to work, get to work !” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson  pulled  off  an  outstanding  piece  of  demagogy  as  he stood  up  with  Paul  Robeson’s  book   <i class="calibre4">Here  I  Stand,12</i>  and  proclaimed  “Program?  This  is  all  the  program  we need.” The book, while  an  excellent  exposition  of  Robeson’s  political  views  as  a militant  anti-imperialist  and  class-conscious fighter, could  by no means serve as a fundamental program for the Party's work in the Black  movement,  and  Jackson  knew it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In late  1957,1 completed work on  <i class="calibre4">Fora Revolutionary Position</i> <i class="calibre4">on  the  Negro  Question</i>.  A  summation  of  a  number  of unpublished articles I had written against reformism in the fifties, the struggles at the Sixteenth Party Convention and afterward, it was intended  to give ideological  clarity to the emerging left in the Party and was later adopted as an official document of the Provisional  Organizing  Committee  (POC).  The  paper  attacked  the Party’s  right  wing  line  and  Jackson’s  view  that  it  would  be  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">“unwarranted interference” for the Party to continue its support of the right of self-determination, undermining the correct leadership of the  bourgeois  assimilationists.  My  paper attacks the revisionists*  failure  to  understand  the  basic orientation  on  the  question, that  “without  the  perspective  of   <i class="calibre4">Political  Power</i>,  the  Negro peoples’  movement  is  reduced  to  an  impotent  appeal  to  the conscience  or  humanitarian  instincts  of  the  country  and  the world.”23</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  essential  in  this  paper  to  answer  James  Allen’s  latest theories.  Abandoning  his  former  support  for  the  right  of  self-determination,  Allen had  become the main  theoretical gun of the revisionists.  His  basically economic determinist approach was to describe an inevitable disintegration of the Black Belt nation now in  process  as  a  result  of the  “forces  of capitalist  development  of great  expansive  power,  which  has  lasted  well  into  the  era  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p642"></a><img src="index-642_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">620</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly  capitalism.”24  According  to  Allen,  this  disintegration was heralded by the failure of the elements of nationhood not only to exist in the Black Belt, but to  <i class="calibre4">be in a fu ll state ofmaturation. </i>  He failed  to  understand  that  “imperialist  oppression,  in  stifling  the development  of  nations,  creates  the  conditions  for  the rise  of national  revolutionary  movements  which,  in  this  epoch,  are  a special phase of the struggle for socialism. This creates the basis for the  revolutionary  alliance  of  the  oppressed  peoples  with  the international  working  class  in  the  struggle  against  the  common enemy,  imperialism.”25</p>
<p class="calibre1">On  November  16,  1957,  a  declaration  was  signed  in  Moscow which had a major effect on the CPUS A. This was the “Declaration of  Communist  and  Workers  Parties  of  Socialist  Countries,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">referred  to  as  the  “Twelve  Party  Declaration.”  (The  signatories included  the Communist  Parties  of Albania,  Bulgaria,  Hungary, North  Vietnam,  East  Germany,  China,  North  Korea,  Mongolia, Poland,  Rumania,  USSR  and  Czechoslovakia.)  The declaration held  that  proletarian  internationalism  as  could  be  understood through  the  lessons  of  history  required  “support  of the  Soviet Union  and  all  the  Socialist  countries  who,  pursuing a  policy  of preserving peace throughout the world, are the mainstay  of peace and  social  progress.”26</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Gates  forces  were  adamantly  opposed  to  our  officially adopting  the  statement  and  resented  the  arguments  of the  more pro-Soviet  elements  in  the  leadership.  The  debates  surrounding our adoption  of the declaration and the threatened  liquidation of the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker</i>,  which  by  this  time  consistently  carried  antiparty,  anti-Soviet  and  anti-communist  propaganda,  brought  the resignation of John Gates in January  1958.  (The declaration was adopted at the next NC meeting in February 1958.) A stream of his supporters  resigned following this.  The whole incident  brought a factional  realignment  in  the  leadership  at  the  February  1958 </p>
<p class="calibre1">National Committee meeting, with the Dennis right-center and the Thompson-Davis  left-center  sharing  the  leadership,  although Dennis  was  definitely  the  top  man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gates’s departure signalled the end of “all trends unity,” the end to the era of “freedom of criticism,” and a new cry in the leadership</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p643"></a><img src="index-643_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">REVISIONISM  TAKES  COMMAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">621</p>
<p class="calibre1">for centralism.  Factionalism  was outlawed and Thompson issued an  ultimatum  to  the  left  at  the  June  1958  NC  meeting,  “Our Party.„has  the  capacity to declare war on factionalism...whether from the direction  of revisionism  or the direction of dogmatism/’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">said  Thompson.27 With the leadership slapping themselves on the back  for  their so-called  “victory against revisionism”—the resignation  of Gates  and  friends—it  was  obvious  that  the  immediate task  was  to  get  rid  of the “ultra-lefts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  strength  and  influence  were  growing  and  with  Gates’s resignation,  conditions were favorable for advancing the struggle against  revisionism  and  conciliationism—for  strengthening  the leadership and prestige of the consistent Marxist forces.  In spite of this  situation,  however,  our left forces under the political leadership of Armando Roman fell into a series of ultra-left errors which in the  long run  led to the dissipation of our prestige and influence and  eventually  to  our  isolation  from  a  large  number  of  honest forces  who  were  in  agreement  with  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We had gradually become more and more oriented  towards the narrow,  inflexible  tactic  of  attack  and  exposure.  Under  these conditions,  the  fundamental  political  questions  upon  which the caucus was founded became relegated to secondary importance as we  largely  confined  ourselves  to  attacking  the  Party’s  position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  purely  oppositionist  tactics,  combined  with  a  refusal  to participate in  mass work, enabled the Party leadership to portray us  as  anti-Party  and  disruptive  elements.  Some  of  the  most blatant ultra-left errors of this  period  included  a refusal to accept posts  on  the  Manhattan  County  Staff (particularly  Armando’s refusal to accept the key post of education director of the county); the  boycott  of  the   <i class="calibre4">Daily  Worker, </i>  even  after  the  resignation  of Gates; and the failure to fight for publication of articles stating our political  position  through  the  official  channels  of  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I must admit self-critically that I tended to overlook these errors, thinking they  were just individual mistakes of a  tactical nature— </p>
<p class="calibre1">not the reflection of an entire ultra-left line.  After years of fighting arch right-wingers, many other comrades in  the caucus made the same mistake.  With Thompson’s ultimatum to the left, many of us began  to  think  that  we  would  very  soon  be  expelled  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p644"></a><img src="index-644_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">622</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">agreed with  Armando’s view that  we should openly split with the Party—a  decision  which  I  now  think  was  incorrect  and  played directly into the hands of the revisionists, who were able to isolate us even further from the rank and file. This decision resulted in the formation  of the  Provisional Organizing Committee for a Communist  Party (POC),  founded  in  August  1958. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  eighty-three  delegates,  mostly  Black  and  Puerto  Rican working  class  cadres,  attended  the  founding  conference  in  New York.  There was much enthusiasm, even euphoria, at the conference—we  thought  we  were  really  on  the  way  to  building  a  new party. Joe Dougher and myself were elected co-chairmen, Armando became the general secretary.  Other members of the executive committee  included  Admiral  Kilpatrick  of Cleveland,  Led  Allen from  West  Virginia,  Angel Torres and Lucille Bethancourt from Cleveland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  all  our fond  hopes,  the  POC continued  under Armando’s leadership  in  an  isolationist  line  and  soon  deteriorated  into  an ultra-left  sect.  There  was  an  ahsolute  refusal  to  apply theory to practice  and  become involved in the day-to-day work among the masses;  a  rejection  on  principle  of  any  compromise  under  any circumstances  over  any  question,  even  over  purely  practical matters.  Those  who  opposed  such  dogmatism  were  promptly labeled  “conciliators.”  The  POC  was  rife  with  inner  caucus witchhunts,  personal  slander  and  character  assassination.  Armando  set himself up as  an  infallible demigod  who  instinctively could  sniff out  not  only  the “conciliators”  in  our  ranks,  but the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“conciliators  of the conciliators.”  There  was,  to  many  of us,  the distinct smell  of police  agentry  about all this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In October 1958, Armando called together a rump conference to have Gwen, myself and a number of other comrades expelled from the POC.  This followed a number of splits with leading comrades like Lannon, Jim  Keller in Chicago and Pat Lumpkin, all of which had  been initiated  by Armando.  I had unwittingly allowed myself to  be  a  part  of some  of this.  It began to smell a little fishy to  me though,  and  I  demanded  an  investigation  and  the  opening of all files. The result was a slander campaign against me—questioning my  motives  and  charging  me  with  abandoning  principle—and</p>

<p class="calibre1">REVISIONISM  TAKES  COMMAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">623</p>
<p class="calibre1">finally  my  expulsion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  hopes  for  a  new  party went  pretty  much  down  the  drain with this and 1 was at loose ends. I wondered what I would do next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 hadn’t yet been expelled from the CPUS A, though everyone else around  me  had  been.  1  figured  that  they  wanted  to  isolate  me completely before they expelled me. I was then working as a waiter in a  French  restaurant  in  Greenwich  Village and was quite happy with my wife and young son, Haywood, born in June 1956. Meanwhile  Gwen  had  lost  custody  of her  son,  Leo  Yuspeh,  and  their visits were restricted by the court to a few hours every other week in a public place. She lost meaningful contact with him and found the situation very  painful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With all these problems converging on us at once, we decided to go to  Mexico to get a fresh perspective on things, study and write. I didn’t know what clsel could do. I flew down to Mexico and Gwen and  Haywood Jr.  followed me a few weeks later. We settled first in Cuautla,  Morelos,  and later in Mexico City, where our daughter Becky  was  born  in  1963. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  were  able  to  eke  out  an  existence Jiving off my  disability pension from the VA and  a little money that Gwen had. I kept in touch  with  things  at  home through  correspondence  with  my old friend Cyril Briggs in Los Angeles.  Briggs was then about seventy-two  and  as  a  leading  member  of  the  Party’s  local  Negro Commission  was  waging  a  pretty  staunch  struggle  against  the revisionists.28</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  in  1959,  with  most  of the  left  out  of  the  Party,  did  the leadership  fully  expose  their  political  positions  in  the  draft resolution  for  the  Seventeenth  Party  Convention.  The  resolution  represented the nearly complete victory of the right and an indication  to  me of just  how  insidious  and  dangerous  an  enemy revisionism is  having point by point, step by step, cut away at all our revolutionary principles in the name of fighting for them. The right  wing  of the  Party  were  not  just  less  militant  fighters,  hut objectively  the  agents  of  the  bourgeoisie  who  had  succeeded  in gaining control  of the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After seeing Jackson’s  crude  and  hlatantly  reformist  program on the Black national question, I decided to write an article for the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p646"></a><img src="index-646_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">624</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">PA</i> as part of the pre-convention discussion. By this time, Jackson had developed the Party's reformist lin e to its lo g i^ conclu$ion,a full  blown  melting pot  theory,  and  1 lambasted him accordingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My article was never printed,  but Briggs rewrote it in his name and reportedly  it  was  distributed  at  the  Seventeenth  Party  Convention  by  the  California delegation.  Though the paper caused quite a stir, the revisionist line on the Afro-American question was officially adopted  at the convention—the right of self-determination  formally dropped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs’s paper was just what Dennis and <b class="calibre3">J a c k s o n   </b>needed  to get rid  of me.  Following  the  convention,  Jackson took  a trip across country.  On  his  way  to  Los  Angeles,  he stopped  in  Mexico City and met with a number of friends there.  My good friend Elizabeth Catlett Mora was among them and asked Jackson about me. 44Oh, he’s  been  expelled,”  he  said  44Hc’s  a  good guy,  hut  we just  had some differences.” And that’s how I found out after thirty-six years that  I  had  been  expelled  from  the Communist  P#rty  USA. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  so  the  right  was  ultimately victorious in the Party’s third major  crisis.  Under  the  guise  of  attacking  an  often  elusive  and ephemeral  “left  sectarianism”  and  “dogmatism,*  they  destroyed the  Party  as  a  vanguard  force,  irrevocably  shoving  it  down  the road  to  revisionism  and  counter-revolution.  It’s  true  that  there were  from  time  to  time  ultra-left  currents  in  the  Party.  These currents mainly developed in response to the rightist of the Parly leadership, as a result of the failure to involve the cadres in political education and play a leading role in the mass movements. But only with  a  few  exceptions  could  these  leftist  deviations  have  been considered the main  danger to the Party.  Most of what had been labeled  by  the  leadership  as  “left  sectarianism*  were  actually honest attempts to oppose the rightist bureaucracy, not the purism and isolationism,  the running ahead of the masses which characterizes  ultra-leftism.29</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  basing  themselves  on  the  thesis  that  left  sectarianism constituted the main danger and was primarily responsible for the isolation of the Party, the right obscured the whole history of class struggle in this country.  It was right <b class="calibre3">opportunism </b>which destroyed the  oncc-powerful  Socialist  Party.  It  was as we h*ve seen,  right</p>

<p class="calibre1">opportunism,  expressed  in  Lovestone’s  theory  of  continued prosperity and  American exemption from economic crisis, which provoked  the  first  Party  crisis in  1927. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  crass  opportunism  and  bourgeois  reformism  of Browder’s  theories  of ’‘progressive  capitalism”  and  an extended period of “harmony of interests between capital and labor” which threw  the  Party  into  its  second  major  crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  once again,  it was right opportunism,  this time expressed largely  in  the  slogan  of  “peaceful,  parliamentary  and  constitutional transition to  socialism,” which plunged the Party into its third and fatal  crisis.  In this crisis, the right successfully threw the Party into a fervor over “left sectarianism,” exaggerating this error in  order  to  obscure  the  history  of the  struggle  against  the right danger  and  prevent  the  Party  from  carefully  and  thoroughly tracing right opportunism to its systematic maturation during the post-war years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  proposition  that  left  sectarianism  constituted  the  main historical  danger  in  the  CPUS A  ignored the  constant  pressures exerted  on  the  Party  by  the  forces  of  bourgeois  ideology  and capitalist development. The particular conditions which American capitalism  developed  under—a  frontier,  vast  resources  and  natural  wealth,  bourgeois  democracy,  an  ability  to  temporarily mediate  economic slump  and  recession, relative periods of prosp erity -all this has tended to act as a force which retards the class consciousness of broad  sections of the labor movement, fostering illusions  that  basic  change  can  take  place  within  the  capitalist system  and  inequities  be solved through  reform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  development  of  capitalism  into  monopoly  capitalism, imperialism  and  the  corresponding  plunder  of  the  Caribbean nations,  the  Philippines  and  Asia,  brought  superprofits into  the coffers of the ruling class, enabling it to cultivate and encourage through money, prestige and influence—a labor aristocracy which serves  as  the  lieutenants  of  capital  within  the  labor  movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  small  elite  section  of  American  labor,  based  among  the upper  strata  of skilled  and  higher  paid  workers,  has through  its leadership in  the trade  unions,  inundated  the working class with</p>

<p class="calibre1">bourgeois  ideology,  promoting  reformism,  narrow  self-interest and  rampant jingoistic  chauvinism.  This  “labor  bureaucracy”  is particularly  susceptible  to  the  imperialist  propaganda  of white chauvinism  and  has  served  to intensify the antagonisms between white and  Black workers, dividing and splitting the working class into  hostile  groups,  retarding  the  development  of revolutionary class consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These objective conditions combined together to provide fertile soil  for  the  maturing  of right  opportunist class collaborationism and chauvinist ideas, outlooks and policies which undoubtedly all heavily affected our Party.  It was out of these concrete conditions that right opportunismdevelopedasthe main danger inthe working class  movement.  My experience in the  Party confirmed  what  the history  of the  working class  struggle  has shown,  that in order to develop  as  a  revolutionary  vanguard,  the  CP  must  constantly struggle  against  tbe  powerful  pressures  of  bourgeois  ideology within its own ranks.  The Party is not separated by a Chinese wall from the corruptive influences of the bourgeois world. In the postwar  period,  bourgeois  influences  within  the  Party  comhined  in effect  with  the  pressures  of  imperialist  repression  upon  the Party.  As  a  source  of revisionism,  illusions  about  the  vitality  of American imperialism were reinforced now by the imprisonment and  terror employed  by  the  government  against  the  Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under these circumstances, the shallowness of the “correction” </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  1945  became  apparent.  Illusions  about  the  possibility  of continued alliance with the liberal bourgeoisie  continued to be the center of the  political orientation of the  Party  leadership.  Simultaneously,  under  the  pressure of the Smith  Act prosecutions,  the Party  leadership  developed  the  theory  of  peaceful  transition  to socialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without  a thorough purge of Browderism, the Party preserved and  built  up  a  bureaucracy  effectively  insulated  against  the operation  of  the  Marxist-Leninist  practice  of criticism  and  self-criticism.  In  this  way,  not  only  was  the  ideological  level  of our Party  forced  to  remain  at  a  low  level,  but  at  the  same  time, unification, purification and corrective replacements of leadership were  made  almost  impossible.  The  end  result  is  a  party  which</p>
