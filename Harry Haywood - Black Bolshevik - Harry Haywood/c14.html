<p class="calibre1">Chapter  14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Reunion  in  Moscow</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nineteen  thirty-two  was  a  presidential  election  year.  We communists  greeted  it  as  an  opportunity  to  popularize  our program  before  the  millions  of  people  impoverished  by  the economic crisis  and  ruling class offensive, as well as to stimulate tnul  strengthen  all  the  campaigns  the  Party was  engaged  in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By this time, the Party had  built considerable influence among llie  masses  through  an  increasingly  successful  struggle  against light  dangers.  We  concentrated  a  good  deal  of attention  on the M niggle for unemployment  insurance and  immediate relief.  Hunger  marches  on  state  capitals  had  taken  place  throughout  the country,  culminating with nationwide marches on Washington in December  of  1931  and  1932. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  struggle  of  employed  workers,  the  Party  found  itself increasingly at loggerheads with William Green and the AFL. For instance,  he  supported  Hoover’s  wage-cut  policies against which wc  had  waged  many  successful  battles.  In direct  defiance  of the AF'l.’s  no-strike  pledge,  the  Party  and  the  TUUL  were  leading nil ikes  in  the  Kentucky  mines  and  the  needle trades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor  and  middle  farmers  were  then  revolting  against  widespread  evictions and foreclosures throughout the midwest, and  in December  1932  farmers  from  across the country  held a National Belief  Conference  in  Washington.  As  a  result,  the  Farmer’s National Committee of Action was set up—raising such demands mm  no  forced  sales  or  evictions  of  poor  farmers,  cash  relief. </p>

<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduction in rents and taxes, and an end to the oppression of Afro-American  people.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">With mass demonstrations  and  meetings throughout the country  to  free  the  Scottsboro  Boys,  the  Party  was  becoming  a respected  leader  among  Blacks.  We  also  helped  organize  the National  Bonus  March  in  July  1932.  Some  25,000  veterans marched  to  Washington,  demanding adjusted service pay;  standing against the danger of imperialist war and for the defense of the Soviet  Union  and  the  Chinese  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We began preparing for the presidential campaign early in 1932, nominating a national slate of William Z.  Foster for president and James  W.  Ford  for  vice-president.  Ford  was  called  hack  from Germany where he had been chairman of the International Trade Union  Committee  of  Negro  Workers.  I  had  been  briefly considered  for vice-president,  but it  was  felt generally  that  my appearance  was  too youthful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though  the  Party's  vote  was  small—about  103,000—we  used the  campaign  to  broadly  publicize  our  minimum  and  maximum programs.2  We  had  a  slate  of congressional  candidates,  among whom  were  many  Blacks.  The  Party  was  on  the  ballot  in forty states  and  conducted  an aggressive campaign.  Hundreds of mass meetings were beld throughout  the country, seven million leaflets distributed  and one million pamphlets sold—all this in the face of vicious  police  harassment  and  repression.  1  don’t  really  believe that  the  final  vote  was  an  accurate  reflection  of  the  Party’s influence at that time—particularly in the South, where the Black masses  were  almost entirely  disenfranchised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the  summer  of  1932,  nineteen-year-old  Angelo  Herndon,  a YCL  member,  was  arrested  in  Atlanta,  Georgia.  Herndon  was charged  with  “incitement  to  insurrection”  under  an  old  1861 </p>
<p class="calibre1">fugitive slave statute.  Much of what I learned was from my brother Otto  who  was  in  Atlanta  at  the  time  and  worked  actively  in the campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That June,  the Fulton County Commissioners had  announced that  there  was  no  more  money  for  relief.  After  all,  there was  no need for relief,  they said—there was no one in the city of Atlanta wbo was starving.  Then they invited  any stray soul who might be</p>

<p class="calibre1">REUNION  IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">381</p>
<p class="calibre1">hungry  to  come  to  their  offices  and  they  would  investigate  the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Communist  Party and  the  Unemployed  Councils immediately took them up on their offer. They mobilized  1,000 people- - </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black and white—to come to the county courthouse and demand relief.  The  meeting itself was  historic—the  first  time that  such  a large  meeting of Black and white workers  had  taken place in  the South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herndon described  its  significance  in  his  autobiography:  “It was a demonstration of the Southern worker’s power. Like a giant that had been  lying asleep for a long time, he now began to stir.”3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Atlanta’s  ruling circles  were appropriately  alarmed  and  the next day  they  found  $6,000 for  relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One week  later, Angelo Herndon was arrested.  His trial was an example of Georgia lynch justice and the local rulers through their newspapers were to use it to sensationalize the “red Jew” scare for many years to come.  I  think the prosecutor’s remarks sum up the situation  pretty  well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falling to his knees, the Reverend Hudson told the jury that he expected  them  to  arrive  at  a  verdict  that  would  ’‘automatically send  this  damnable  anarchistic  Bolsheviki  to  his  death  by electrocution.”  The  good  reverend  said  that  this  would  satisfy God  and  the “daughters of the state officials can walk the streets safely.  Stamp  this  thing out  now  with  a  conviction.”4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hudson  didn’t  get  everything  he  asked  for,  but  Herndon was sentenced  to  eighteen to  twenty  years.  Before  he  was  sentenced, however,  young  Herndon  told  the  court:  “You  may  succeed  in killing one, two, even a score of working-class organizers. But you cannot  kill  the  working  class.”5</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  heginning  stages  of  the  case,  the  1LD  had  immediately taken charge of the defense, which was then in the hands of a young Black Atlanta attorney, Ben Davis, Jr. The case was linked up  with  the  Scottshoro  struggle  as  a  symbol  of  the  racist persecution  of Blacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  long  legal  battle  ensued.  Mass  meetings  and  huge  petition campaigns  were  launched  as  part  of the  defense effort.  The case was fought through to the Supreme Court, which at first sustained</p>

<p class="calibre1">382</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">the conviction, but ultimately reversed it by a live to four decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herndon,  out  on  bail,  was  finally  freed  in  1937. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as we had received word of Herndon’s arrest, we began planning a nationwide defense campaign. The Negro Department was  responsible  for  developing  and  carrying  out  a  campaign in support  of the 1LD.  As part  of this  effort  I  made  plans to go to Atlanta  to  see the  situation  first  hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly before I was to leave, however, Browder called me into his office and informed  me that he had just received  a Cl request that the American Party send three delegates to attend the Twelfth Plenum  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  Communist  International. Browder asked if I would like to go; the meeting was to be in  Moscow  in early September.  He said  that he was aware of my desire to  bring my wife Ina to the United States, and he suggested that this might be a good opportunity. 1, of course, enthusiastically agreed.  Just  a  few days  later,  I  was  aboard  ship—bound  for the Soviet  Union—with  the  other  two  delegates,  Bob  Minor  and Henry  Puro (a  Finnish-American  comrade). </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  arrived  in  Moscow  in  mid-August  and  I  had  a  joyous reunion with Ina. Not long after our arrival, the Twelfth Plenum of the  ECC1  convened  as  scheduled.  Its purpose was to analyse the current  international situation and check the work of the Comintern  sections,  the  affiliated  parties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  tone  was  set  in  the  resolution  on  the  international  situation.  It  noted  that  capitalist  stabilization  had  ended,  that  we were  well  along  in  the  third  period,  and  that  although  a  revolutionary  upsurge  was  developing  in  a  number  of  countries,  a revolutionary  situation  had  not  yet  arisen  in  any  important capitalist country. The resolution stressed the danger of war and the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"preparation for a counter-revolutionary war against the USSR.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  enemy,  it  declared,  was  both  fascism  and  social-fascism (social democracy), which stood for the maintenance and strengthening  of  capitalism.  "Only  by  directing  the  main  blow  against social democracy, this social mainstay of the bourgeoisie,” it said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"will it  be possible to strike at and defeat the chief class enemy of the  proletariat...the  bourgeoisie.”6</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  United  States </p>
<p class="calibre1">there </p>
<p class="calibre1">had </p>
<p class="calibre1">already </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  mass</p>

<p class="calibre1">REUNION  IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">383</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstrations  of the unemployed,  the veterans’  march  and  the h i  rike struggles  against  wage cuts. The  resolution  called upon the IJ.S.  Party  to  continue  to strengthen its efforts in  mobilizing the masses,  and towards this end to “concentrate chiefly on the struggle:  1. for social insurance, against wage cuts, for immediate assistance for the unemployed; 2. for assistance for the ruined farmers; I,  for equal  rights of the Negroes and the right of self-determina-lion for the Black Belt.” It urged the defense of the Chinese people against  foreign  aggression  and  defense  of  the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was nothing new in all this.  The  Party was in agreement with all these points and had taken part in discussions which led to the  formulation  of his  speech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  visited  the  Lenin </p>
<p class="calibre1">School  where </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  reported </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afro-American  work  in  the  Party.  The  student  body  was completely  new  to  me;  there  were  a  number  of  American  Black students  as  well  as  several  South  Africans.  One  was  Nzula,  the secretary of the South African Communist Party, a brilliant young Zulu communist. Unfortunately Nzula died of pneumonia shortly nfter  I  left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Moscow  I  also  met  members  of the  Black  and  white  film group who  had come to the Soviet  Union  at the invitation  of the <i class="calibre4">Mezhrabpom</i> (Soviet  film  industry).  The twenty-two young men and women were there to film a story about race and class relations in the Southern United States.  Among them were the novelist and poet  Langston  Hughes;  Louise Thompson (now  Louise Thompson  Patterson),  secretary  of  the  Committee  for  the  Defense  of Political  Prisoners  and  a  former  social  worker  and  teacher;  Ted Poston,  a New York journalist;  Loren  Miller, a young west coast intellectual,  later  a  lawyer  and judge;  and  Henry Moon,  a writer who later became publicity director of the NAACP.  They seemed to be having a good time among the hospitable Russians who went out  of their  way  to  show them  courtesy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a stay of several  months and a number of attempts to get started,  the  movie  was  called  off.  The  reason,  according  to <i class="calibre4">Mezhrabpom</i> officials, was the inadequacy of the scenario.  It was not worthy of the kind of picture they had hoped to make, nor were the actors  quite  wbat  they  expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p406"></a><img src="index-406_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">384</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were a group of intellectuals, not a genuine worker among them  and only one professional  actor.  Most  were from the north and knew little or nothing about the South.  Some members of the group,  however,  contended  that  the  reasons  for  canceling  the project  were political--that  the  Soviets  were backing away from the  project  in  order  to  curry  favor  witb  the  U.S.  government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  claimed  that  equal  rights  were  being  sacrificed  and  the Soviets were betraying Blacks in exchange for diplomatic relations with the United  States.  At  the time, the two countries were about to  establish  diplomatic  relations,  and  a  film  depicting  racial relations  in  the  U.S.  might  be  considered  a  violation  of  the proposed  treaty  of  recognition  which  enjoined  both  parties  to refrain  from  hostile  propaganda  against  the  other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This charge was picked up, embellished and hurled throughout the  world  by  the  capitalist  press.  Added  to  it  were  accounts  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ppor  Blacks  stranded  in  Moscow.”  Tbe   <i class="calibre4">New  York  Tribune</i> headlined  a  story  “Negroes  Adrift  in  ‘Unde  Tom's’  Russian Cabin-  Harlem  Expeditionary  Unit  is  Stranded  in  Moscow.”7</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  couple  of years  later  when  George  Padmore  left  his post  as editor  of the   <i class="calibre4">Negro  Worker</i>  (organ  of the  International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers in Hamburg), he made use of this incident to try to bolster his flimsy charge that the Communist International  had  deserted  the  African  liberation  struggles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  charges  were false.  According to  Langston  Hughes, the group  was  on  contract  and  continued  to  receive  their  salaries— </p>
<p class="calibre1">higher than any of them had ever earned before. They were staying in  a luxurious  hotel,  were  wined and dined  by the  Russians,  and were also invited  by the theatrical union on a  pleasure trip to the Black  Sea  to  visit  the  resorts  of  tbe  Crimea  and  the  Caucasus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Langston  Hughes  also  supported  the  Russians with  respect to the  inadequacy  of the  script.  In  fact,  it  was  he who  called  their attention  to  it.  He  had read  the  script,  written  by a  well-known Soviet scenarist whose knowledge of contemporary Black life was limited  to  the  very  few  books  on  the  subject  which  had  been translated  into  Russian.  He had  evidently  studied  these  and  put together  what  he  thought  was  a  highly  dramatic  story  of  race relations  in  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p407"></a><img src="index-407_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">REUNION  IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">385</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  result,  said  Hughes, “was a script improbable to the point of  ludicrousness.  It  was  so  interwoven  with  major  and  minor impossibilities and improbabilities that  it would have seemed like a  burlesque  on  the  screen."  He  told  studio  officials  that  in  his opinion, "no plausible film could possibly be made from it since, in general, the script was so mistakenly conceived that it was beyond revision."8</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Mezhrabpom</i> informed the group that they would be paid in full for  the  duration  of  their  contracts  and  that  transportation  via London,  Paris  or  Berlin  back  to  the  U.S.  would  be  availahle whenever  they wished  to depart.  With  regard to the future,  three choices were offered; exit visas at any time, an extended tour of the Soviet  Union  before leaving, or permanent residence and jobs for any who desired to remain. All were invited to stay in the USSR as long as  they  wished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Langston remained a year, visiting republics in central Asia and traveling in various parts of the Soviet Union. Two members of the group stayed permanently.  Wayland Rudd, the actor, appeared in Moscow theaters and  performed for the troops at the front during World  War  II.  Lloyd  Patterson,  a  scene  designer  who  was  a graduate  of  Hampton  Institute  in  Virginia,  married  a  Russian woman  and  stayed  in the Soviet  Union where he died  during the Nazi  invasion  of Moscow.  His  wife,  Vera,  also a scene designer, was  a  friend  of Ina’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Homer  Smith,  a  former  postal  employee  from  Minneapolis, stayed in the Soviet Union until the beginning of World War II. He got  a contract with the  Russian  postal  service and introduced the llrst  special  delivery  to  Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  I  was  there,  Mother  Wright  (mother  of  one  of  the Scottsboro  Boys)  was  on  a tour  of Russia  and  spoke to a whole series  of  mass  rallies,  culminating  in  a  huge demonstration  and parade  of tens  of thousands  of Soviet workers  in  Moscow.  They went  through  the  main  streets  of  Moscow  with  placards  and banners:  "Free  the  Scottsboro  Boys!"  "Down  with  U.S.  Imperialism!"  and  "7*he  Soviet  Union--Friend  of  the  Oppressed Blacks"  This  enthusiastic  support  of  the  Russians  for  the Scottsboro  Boys  further  belied  these  slanders. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p408"></a><img src="index-408_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">386</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">One day I dropped in at the Bolshoi Moscow Hotel to visit some members  of  the  film  group.  Entering  the  lobby  I  saw  my  old KUTVA schoolmate Golden and  we ran into a Russian embrace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had  gone back to the States in  1928 and  had  now returned to the  Soviet  Union  with  a  new  wife,  a  Polish-American  woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  had  settled  in  Tashkent  in  central  Asia,  where  he  was professor  of  English  literature  at  the  university.  His  wife  also taught  there  and  they  had  a  baby  daughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden  told  me  what  had  happened  to  him  in  the  past years.  Back  in  the  U.S.,  he  had  found  it  difficult  to  fit  into Party  work.  *T  was  neither  an  organizer  nor  an  agitator  and I  felt  1  was  too  old  to  acquire  these  qualities,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(He  was  then  about forty)  “As you know,  I  never had any  Party experience  before coming to  Russia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  felt  that  he could,  perhaps, eventually  become a teacher of Marxian  political  economy.  “You  know  I  was good  at  that,”  he said.  He was in  fact,  an extremely modest and retiring fellow, not one to blow  his  own  horn.  I would say the comrades in the States did  not  know of his qualifications in this respect.  He had worked awhile as the manager of the Party restaurant in New York. Then he was sent as organizer to Pittsburgh, but, as he himself admitted, did  a  poor job  there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was a loyal communist, however, and it occurred to him that there was one thing he could do for the Soviet U nion and that was to  organize  a  group  of  Black  technicians  to  go  there  to  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Approaching his  old  teacher at Tuskegee, the famed  Dr.  George Washington Carver, he solicited his aid in getting together a group of agricultural  specialists  to  go  to  the  Soviet  Union.  Dr.  Carver seemed  enthusiastic  about  the  project  and  immediately  sought volunteers  from  among his  former students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  eventually  got  together  a  group  of  nine  agricultural specialists, agronomists and agricultural chemists. There was also one  young  civil  engineer,  Charles  Young,  the  son  of  Colonel Young—West Point graduate and highest ranking Black officer in the  U.S.  Army  at  the  beginning  of World  War  I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole group signed contracts through the   <i class="calibre4">Anttorg</i> (Soviet trading organization in the U.S.).  Led by Golden, they left for the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p409"></a><img src="index-409_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">REUNION IN  MOSCOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">387</p>
<p class="calibre1">USSR.  Otto told  me he saw them  off when  they sailed from New York.  He  asked  Golden  when  he  was  coming  hack.  Repeating a verse of the once-popular song, Golden replied, 4T11 be hack when the  elephants  roost  in  the  trees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden died in Tashkent just before World War II. In addition to his work as a professor, he was at that time a member of the city Soviet.  He must  have  been a very popular man because we heard that the  whole town  turned  out  for his  funeral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of the  young  Black  technicians  remained  permanently, married and had families in the Soviet Union. One became head of the  largest  state  poultry  farm  in  the  Soviet  Union and  another, Sutton,  an  agricultural  chemist  from  San  Antonio,  Texas,  invented  a process  for  producing rope  from  rice  straw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My desire to bring Ina back to the States was made known to the appropriate  authorities.  We  had  no  trouble  at  all.  She  was immediately given an exit visa. Naturally, her mother was sorry to be  separated  from  her  only  child,  but  she  approved  of  Ina’s leaving—saying  she  wanted  her daughter to  be  happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We left Moscow for Riga, site of the nearest American embassy (the  Soviet  Union  was  not  recognized  by  the  U.S.  at  this  time). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving  in  Riga we proceeded at once to the American embassy lo  get  the  necessary  papers  which  would  allow  Ina  to enter  the United States as my wife and become a permanent resident. At the lime,  I  thought  there  was  a  possibility  of  getting  immediate approval so she could come through with me. I knew that this had happened in some cases,  but I was quickly disabused of this naive hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  embassy  I  was  subjected  to  a  quiz;  the  ambassador himself took part in the questioning, I could tell by his accent that he  was  a  polite  Southern  gentleman.  Behind  the  mask,  I  could sense the  hostility towards  me,  I told them I was a writer and had spent  time  in  the  Soviet  Union  a  couple  of years before.  There I had  met  Ina,  and  we had gotten  married.  Now  I  had  returned to bring her back with me. They asked me all sorts of questions about I he Soviet  Union—how I liked it, what  it  was like.  I gave general unswers.  It  was  clear  they  knew  ail  along wbo  I was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally  I was told  that  they didn’t handle visas from that office</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p410"></a><img src="index-410_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">388</p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK  BOLSHEVIK</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  this  connection.  I  would  have to go back to the United States and  apply  through  the Immigration Department to  bring Ina  in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  assured  me I would have no problem.  I  should leave Ina in Riga. This, they said, was the normal procedure. The ambassador, keeping up  the friendly facade,  bade me goodbye  in a polite way and  wished  me luck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, we had friends in Riga. The Armenian Vartanyan, a member of the YCI, had given us the name of his uncle, a wealthy doctor  in  the city, who had  his own health sanitarium.  Ina could stay there  as  a  guest  as  long  as  she  wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The city of Riga was a notorious spy center. A listening post for the  U.S.,  it  was  the  nearest  place  to  gather  information  on  the Soviet  Union  for  U.S.  intelligence.  Many  of  the  anti-Soviet </p>
<p class="calibre1">“experts” were centered there,  and  the city served as a lie factory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example,  they  reported  twenty million people had starved  to death  in  famines  in  1932.  I  was  there  that  year,  and  while  I  saw some tightening of the belt as a result of the bad harvest, there was no  starvation.  Then  there  was  even  cruder  stuff  about  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“nationalization  of  women”—all  invented  by  newspapermen  in the  bars  in  Riga.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was in Riga just three or four days and regretfully left Ina with the doctor and  his family.  He assured me everything would be all right.  We  went to the station where I caught the train for Berlin; Ina  and  1  embraced,  and  she  watched  as  the  train  pulled  out.  I never  saw  her  again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  Berlin  1  went to  Bremerhaven and got passage  borne on the liner  <i class="calibre4">Bremen. </i> Immediately on arrival in the States I went to the Immigration office on Ellis Island to apply for a visa for Ina. Here they  were  quite  rude.  One  guy  asked  me,  “Who  is  she—a communist?  We’re  not  letting  any  communists  in,  you  know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  said,  “No.  Sbe’s  just  a  Soviet  citizen.”  They  gave  me  an application  to  fill  out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  then  asked  when  I  could  hear from them and they told  me  it would  be  a  month or so.  “Why  does  it  take so  long?”  I  asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  said  they  had  to  investigate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I kept in close touch with Ina assuring her that things would turn out  all  right.  I  also  called  the  Immigration  Department,  con-</p>

<p class="calibre1">389</p>
<p class="calibre1">rtantly inquiring about  the  application. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  several  months,  I  became  convinced  my  application  for Iim’s  visa  was  being deliberately  obstructed  by the  Immigration Department  itself.  So  1 started  my own campaign, assisted by my Iricnd  William  Patterson,  then  national  secretary  of  the  International  Labor Defense.  We felt the best way to get results was to  threaten  the  immigration authorities with public exposure—it was*  a  clear case  of discrimination  against  a  Black  man! </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  enlisted  the  support  of  several  liberals,  including  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">&lt;  ommittee for the Defense of Political Prisoners headed by Rabbi Benjamin  Goldstein  and  Malcolm  Cowley of the American Civil Liberties  Union.  They addressed  a telegram  to the commissioner of immigration  in  Washington,  demanding to  know  the  reasons lor  the  delay  and  denouncing  this  inhuman  treatment.  uIs  it because  she  is  white  and  Mr.  Hall  is  Negro?”  they  asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We got an immediate reply from the commissioner himself.  He denied the delay had  anything to do with racial discrimination and niiid he would Eke to see Mr. Hall down in Washington so we could talk  the  matter  over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pat  and  I  went  down  to  the  office  of  the  commissioner  in Washington.  Patterson,  as my attorney, was on the offensive and luunched  right  in.  But  the  commissioner told  him to  hold  back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ihere’s no discrimination here, he told us, but of course, we’re not going to let any communists in.  We objected, saying she was not a communist, just  a citizen  of the  Soviet  Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  the  commissioner  raised  the  question  of  my  previous marriage.  They  as  yet  had  no  proof  of the  termination  of  that marriage. 1 replied that that was no problem; I would get the proof lor  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly  after  I  had  arrived  in  Moscow in  1926,1  had  gotten  a Idler from my sister Eppa. She told me she had run into Hazel, my former  wife.  Hazel  had  told  her  she  had  divorced  me,  was remarried and  had some children. So I assumed there would be no trouble  getting confirmation  of the  divorce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1  immediately went to Chicago and saw my sister She repeated wluit  she  had  written  to  me, told  me where Hazel was  living and t hen took me there to see her. I explained to Hazel that I needed to</p>

<p class="calibre1">get  confirmation of our divorce.  But she said  she hadn't divorced me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do  you  mean?*  I  asked,  amazed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, it’s against my religion. My church doesn’t approve of divorces,”  she  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was astounded. Here she was living with someone else and with children,  but  she  couldn’t  approve  of divorce! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  wrote  Ina,  telling  her  what  had  transpired  and  told  her  I thought the best thing to do  was for her to go back to Moscow.  I would  get  a  divorce  as quickly  as  I  could  and  then  go  back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  I  got  bogged  down  in  work.  There  was  no  money  for  a divorce,  and  no  guarantee  that  even  with  the  divorce,  I  would be able to get Ina into the country.  I felt very sad ahout this and we did  exchange letters for a time,  but I was unable to get back to the Soviet  Union in the thirties  and we eventually lost contact. I later heard  from  friends  who  had  visited  Moscow  that  she  had remarried. </p>
