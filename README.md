I've been working on formatting Black Bolshevik into EPUB and webpages to make it more accessible, as it's a very long book. At the moment chapters 1-3 are finished. Please contribute if you have the time.

For typos and misprints, I am using this PDF as a basis of comparison http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=AAF60EC535C8BCBE403DCF8E83CB5406
